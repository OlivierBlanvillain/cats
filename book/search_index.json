is a library which provides abstractions for functional programming in Scala.\nThe name is a playful shortening of the word category.\n\nGetting Started\nCats is currently available for Scala 2.10 and 2.11.\nTo get started with SBT, simply add the following to your build.sbt\nfile:\nlibraryDependencies += &quot;org.typelevel&quot; %% &quot;cats&quot; % &quot;0.6.0&quot;\n\nThis will pull in all of Cats&#39; modules. If you only require some\nfunctionality, you can pick-and-choose from amongst these modules\n(used in place of &quot;cats&quot;):\n\ncats-macros: Macros used by Cats syntax (required).\ncats-kernel: Small set of basic type classes (required).\ncats-core: Most core type classes and functionality (required).\ncats-laws: Laws for testing type class instances.\ncats-free: Free structures such as the free monad, and supporting type classes.\n\nRelease notes for Cats are available in CHANGES.md.\nCats is still under active development. While we don&#39;t anticipate any\n major redesigns, changes that are neither source nor binary\n compatibility are to be expected in upcoming cats releases. We will\n update the minor version of cats accordingly for such changes. Once\n cats 1.0 is released (ETA: Q3 2016), there will be an increased focus\n on making changes in compatible ways.\nDocumentation\nDocumentation is here.\nAmong the goals of Cats is to provide approachable and useful documentation. Documentation is available in the form of tutorials on the Cats website, as ePub, Mobi or PDF, as well as through Scaladoc (also reachable through the website).\nBuilding Cats\nTo build Cats you should have\nsbt and Node.js\n installed. Run sbt, and then use any of the following commands:\n\ncompile: compile the code\nconsole: launch a REPL\ntest: run the tests\nunidoc: generate the documentation\nscalastyle: run the style-checker on the code\nvalidate: run tests, style-checker, and doc generation\n\nScala and Scala-js\nCats cross-compiles to both JVM and Javascript(JS). If you are not used to\nworking with cross-compiling builds, the first things that you will notice is that\nbuilds:\n\nWill take longer: To build JVM only, just use the catsJVM, or catsJS for\nJS only. And if you want the default project to be catsJVM, just copy the\nfile scripts/sbtrc-JVM to .sbtrc in the root directory.\n\nMay run out of memory: We suggest you use\nPaul Philips&#39;s sbt script that will use the settings from Cats.\n\n\nDesign\nThe goal is to provide a lightweight, modular, and extensible library\nthat is approachable and powerful. We will also provide useful\ndocumentation and examples which are type-checked by the compiler to\nensure correctness.\nCats will be designed to use modern best practices:\n\nsimulacrum for minimizing type class boilerplate\nmachinist for optimizing implicit operators\nscalacheck for property-based testing\ndiscipline for encoding and testing laws\nkind-projector for type lambda syntax\nalgebra for shared algebraic structures\n...and of course a pure functional subset of the Scala language.\n\n(We also plan to support Miniboxing in a branch.)\nCurrently Cats is experimenting with providing laziness via a type\nconstructor (Eval[_]), rather than via ad-hoc by-name\nparameters.This design may change if it ends up being impractical.\nThe goal is to make Cats as efficient as possible for both strict and\nlazy evaluation. There are also issues around by-name parameters that\nmean they are not well-suited to all situations where laziness is\ndesirable.\nModules\nCats will be split into modules, both to keep the size of the\nartifacts down and also to avoid unnecessarily tight coupling between\ntype classes and data types.\nInitially Cats will support the following modules:\n\nmacros: Macro definitions needed for core and other projects.\ncore: Definitions for widely-used type classes and data types.\nlaws: The encoded laws for type classes, exported to assist third-party testing.\ncats-free: Free structures such as the free monad, and supporting type classes.\ntests: Verifies the laws, and runs any other tests. Not published.\n\nAs the type class families grow, it&#39;s possible that additional modules\nwill be added as well. Modules which depend on other libraries\n(e.g. Shapeless-based type class derivation) may be added as well.\nHow can I contribute to Cats?\nThere are many ways to support Cats&#39; development:\n\nFix bugs: Despite using static types, law-checking, and\nproperty-based testing bugs can happen. Reporting problems you\nencounter (with the documentation, code, or anything else) helps us\nto improve. Look for issues labelled &quot;ready&quot; as good targets, but\nplease add a comment to the issue if you start working on one.\nWe want to avoid any duplicated effort.\n\nWrite ScalaDoc comments: One of our goals is to have ScalaDoc\ncomments for all types in Cats. The documentation should describe\nthe type and give a basic usage (it may also link to relevant\npapers).\n\nWrite tutorials and examples: In addition to inline ScalaDoc\ncomments, we hope to provide Markdown-based tutorials which can\ndemonstrate how to use all the provided types. These should be\nliterate programs i.e. narrative text interspersed with code.\n\nImprove the laws and tests: Cats&#39; type classes rely on laws (and\nlaw-checking) to make type classes useful and reliable. If you\nnotice laws or tests which are missing (or could be improved)\nyou can open an issue (or send a pull request).\n\nHelp with code review: Most of our design decisions are made\nthrough conversations on issues and pull requests. You can\nparticipate in these conversations to help guide the future of\nCats.\nWe will be using the meta label for large design decisions, and\nyour input on these is especially appreciated.\n\nContribute new code: Cats is growing!

One advantage of opening an issue is that it may\nsave you time to get other opinions on your approach.\n\nAsk questions: we are hoping to make Cats (and functional\nprogramming in Scala) accessible to the largest number of\npeople.

You think of it as an\n&quot;interface&quot; in the Java sense. Here&#39;s an example.\n/**\n * A type class to provide textual representation\n */\ntrait Show[A] {\n  def show(f: A): String\n}\n\nThis class says that a value of type Show[A] has a way to turn As\ninto Strings. Now we can write a function which is polymorphic on\nsome A, as long as we have some value of Show[A], so that our function\ncan have a way of producing a String:\ndef log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))\n\nIf we now try to call log, without supplying a Show instance, we will\nget a compilation error:\nscala&gt; log(&quot;a string&quot;)\n&lt;console&gt;:15: error: could not find implicit value for parameter s: Show[String]\n       log(&quot;a string&quot;)\n          ^\n\nIt is trivial to supply a Show instance for String:\nimplicit val stringShow = new Show[String] {\n  def show(s: String) = s\n}\n\nand now our call to Log succeeds\nlog(&quot;a string&quot;)\n// a string\n\nThis example demonstrates a powerful property of the type class\npattern. We have been able to provide an implementation of Show for\nString, without needing to change the definition of java.lang.String\nto extend a new Java-style interface; something we couldn&#39;t have done\neven if we wanted to, since we don&#39;t control the implementation of\njava.lang.String. We use this pattern to retrofit existing\ntypes with new behaviors. This is usually referred to as &quot;ad-hoc\npolymorphism&quot;.\nFor some types, providing a Show instance might depend on having some\nimplicit Show instance of some other type, for instance, we could\nimplement Show for Option:\nimplicit def optionShow[A](implicit sa: Show[A]) = new Show[Option[A]] {\n  def show(oa: Option[A]): String = oa match {\n    case None =&gt; &quot;None&quot;\n    case Some(a) =&gt; &quot;Some(&quot;+ sa.show(a) + &quot;)&quot;\n  }\n}\n\nNow we can call our log function with a Option[String] or a\nOption[Option[String]]:\nlog(Option(Option(&quot;hello&quot;)))\n// Some(Some(hello))\n\nScala has syntax just for this pattern that we use frequently:\ndef log[A: Show](a: A) = println(implicitly[Show[A]].show(a))\n\nis the same as\ndef log[A](a: A)(implicit s: Show[A]) = println(s.show(a))\n\nThat is that declaring the type parameter as A : Show, it will add\nan implicit parameter to the method signature (with a name we do not know).\n"},"applicative.html":{"url":"applicative.html","title":"Applicative","body":"Applicative\nApplicative extends Apply by adding a single method,\npure:\n    def pure[A](x: A): F[A]\n`\n\nThis method takes any value and returns the value in the context of\nthe functor.

Instead of the entire cats package, you can import only the types that you need, for example:\nimport cats.Monad\nimport cats.Semigroup\nimport cats.Foldable\n\nThe cats.data._, import brings in data structures such as Xor, Validated, and State. Instead of the entire cats.data package, you can import only the types that you need, for example:\nimport cats.data.Xor\nimport cats.data.Validated\nimport cats.data.State\n\nThe cats.implicits._ import does a couple of things. Firstly, it brings in implicit type class instances for standard library types - so after this import you will have Monad[List] and Semigroup[Int] instances in implicit scope. Secondly, it adds syntax enrichment onto certain types to provide some handy methods, for example:\n// cats adds a toXor method to the standard library&#39;s Either\nval e: Either[String, Int] = Right(3)\n// e: Either[String,Int] = Right(3)\n\ne.toXor\n// res1: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Right(3)\n\n// cats adds an orEmpty method to the standard library&#39;s Option\nval o: Option[String] = None\n// o: Option[String] = None\n\no.orEmpty\n// res3: String = &quot;&quot;\n\nNote: if you import cats.implicits._ (the preferred method), you should not also use imports like cats.syntax.option._ or cats.std.either._. This can result in ambiguous implicit values that cause bewildering compile errors.\nWhy can&#39;t the compiler find implicit instances for Future?\nIf you have already followed the imports advice but are still getting error messages like could not find implicit value for parameter e: cats.Monad[scala.concurrent.Future] or value |+| is not a member of scala.concurrent.Future[Int], then make sure that you have an implicit scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext in scope. The easiest way to do this is to import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global, but note that you may want to use a different execution context for your production application.\nHow can I turn my List of &lt;something&gt; into a &lt;something&gt; of a list?\nIt&#39;s really common to have a List of values with types like Option, Xor, or Validated that you would like to turn &quot;inside out&quot; into an Option (or Xor or Validated) of a List. The sequence, sequenceU, traverse, and traverseU methods are really handy for this. You can read more about them in the Traverse documentation.\nHow can I help?\nThe cats community welcomes and encourages contributions, even if you are completely new to cats and functional programming. Here are a few ways to help out:\n\nFind an undocumented method and write a ScalaDoc entry for it. See Arrow.scala for some examples of ScalaDoc entries that use sbt-doctest.\nLook at the code coverage report, find some untested code, and write a test for it. Even simple helper methods and syntax enrichment should be tested.\nFind an open issue, leave a comment on it to let people know you are working on it, and submit a pull request. If you are new to cats, you may want to look for items with the low-hanging-fruit label.\n\nSee the contributing guide for more information.\n"},"foldable.html":{"url":"foldable.html","title":"Foldable","body":"Foldable\nFoldable type class instances can be defined for data structures that can be \nfolded to a summary value.\nIn the case of a collection (such as List or Set), these methods will fold \ntogether (combine) the values contained in the collection to produce a single \nresult.

(This is in contrast to a type like Int which has\nno hole, or Tuple2 which has two holes (Tuple2[?,?])).\nThe Functor category involves a single operation, named map:\ndef map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): F[B]\n\nThis method takes a function A =&gt; B and turns an F[A] into an\nF[B].  The name of the method map should remind you of the map\nmethod that exists on many classes in the Scala standard library, for\nexample:\nOption(1).map(_ + 1)\n// res0: Option[Int] = Some(2)\n\nList(1,2,3).map(_ + 1)\n// res1: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 4)\n\nVector(1,2,3).map(_.toString)\n// res2: scala.collection.immutable.Vector[String] = Vector(1, 2, 3)\n\nCreating Functor instances\nWe can trivially create a Functor instance for a type which has a well\nbehaved map method:\nimport cats._\n\nimplicit val optionFunctor: Functor[Option] = new Functor[Option] {\n  def map[A,B](fa: Option[A])(f: A =&gt; B) = fa map f\n}\n\nimplicit val listFunctor: Functor[List] = new Functor[List] {\n  def map[A,B](fa: List[A])(f: A =&gt; B) = fa map f\n}\n\nHowever, functors can also be created for types which don&#39;t have a map\nmethod.

We\ncertainly could write one that takes a List[User] and fetch profile for all of them, would be a bit strange.\nIf we just wanted to fetch the profile of just one user, we would either have to wrap it in a List or write\na separate function that takes in a single user anyways. More fundamentally, functional programming is about\nbuilding lots of small, independent pieces and composing them to make larger and larger pieces - does this\nhold true in this case?\nGiven just User =&gt; Future[Profile], what should we do if we want to fetch profiles for a List[User]?\nWe could try familiar combinators like map.\ndef profilesFor(users: List[User]) = users.map(userInfo)\n// profilesFor: (users: List[User])List[scala.concurrent.Future[Profile]]\n\nNote the return type List[Future[Profile]]. This makes sense given the type signatures, but seems unwieldy.\nWe now have a list of asynchronous values, and to work with those values we must then use the combinators on\nFuture for every single one. It would be nicer instead if we could get the aggregate result in a single\nFuture, say a Future[List[Profile]].\nAs it turns out, the Future companion object has a traverse method on it. However, that method is\nspecialized to standard library collections and Futures - there exists a much more generalized form\nthat would allow us to parse a List[String] or validate credentials for a List[User].\nEnter Traverse.\nThe type class\nAt center stage of Traverse is the traverse method.\ntrait Traverse[F[_]] {\n  def traverse[G[_] : Applicative, A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; G[B]): G[F[B]]\n}\n\nIn our above example, F is List, and G is Option, Xor, or Future. For the profile example,\ntraverse says given a List[User] and a function User =&gt; Future[Profile], it can give you a\nFuture[List[Profile]].\nAbstracting away the G (still imagining F to be List), traverse says given a collection of data,\nand a function that takes a piece of data and returns an effectful value, it will traverse the collection,\napplying the function and aggregating the effectful values (in a List) as it goes.\nIn the most general form, F[_] is some sort of context which may contain a value (or several). While\nList tends to be among the most general cases, there also exist Traverse instances for Option,\nXor, and Validated (among others).\nChoose your effect\nThe type signature of Traverse appears highly abstract, and indeed it is - what traverse does as it\nwalks the F[A] depends on the effect of the function. Let&#39;s see some examples where F is taken to be\nList.\nNote in the following code snippet we are using traverseU instead of traverse.\ntraverseU is for all intents and purposes the same as traverse, but with some\ntype-level trickery\nto allow it to infer the Applicative[Xor[A, ?]] and Applicative[Validated[A, ?]]\ninstances - scalac has issues inferring the instances for data types that do not\ntrivially satisfy the F[_] shape required by Applicative.\nimport cats.Semigroup\nimport cats.data.{NonEmptyList, OneAnd, Validated, ValidatedNel, Xor}\nimport cats.implicits._\n\ndef parseIntXor(s: String): Xor[NumberFormatException, Int] =\n  Xor.catchOnly[NumberFormatException](s.toInt)\n\ndef parseIntValidated(s: String): ValidatedNel[NumberFormatException, Int] =\n  Validated.catchOnly[NumberFormatException](s.toInt).toValidatedNel\n\nExamples.\nval x1 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).traverseU(parseIntXor)\n// x1: cats.data.Xor[NumberFormatException,List[Int]] = Right(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nval x2 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).traverseU(parseIntXor)\n// x2: cats.data.Xor[NumberFormatException,List[Int]] = Left(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;)\n\nval x3 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;).traverseU(parseIntXor)\n// x3: cats.data.Xor[NumberFormatException,List[Int]] = Left(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;)\n\nval v1 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).traverseU(parseIntValidated)\n// v1: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.OneAnd[[+A]List[A],NumberFormatException],List[Int]] = Valid(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nval v2 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;3&quot;).traverseU(parseIntValidated)\n// v2: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.OneAnd[[+A]List[A],NumberFormatException],List[Int]] = Invalid(OneAnd(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;,List()))\n\nval v3 = List(&quot;1&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;def&quot;).traverseU(parseIntValidated)\n// v3: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.OneAnd[[+A]List[A],NumberFormatException],List[Int]] = Invalid(OneAnd(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;,List(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;def&quot;)))\n\nNotice that in the Xor case, should any string fail to parse the entire traversal\nis considered a failure. Moreover, once it hits its first bad parse, it will not\nattempt to parse any others down the line (similar behavior would be found with\nusing Option as the effect). Contrast this with Validated where even\nif one bad parse is hit, it will continue trying to parse the others, accumulating\nany and all errors as it goes. The behavior of traversal is closely tied with the\nApplicative behavior of the data type.\nGoing back to our Future example, we can write an Applicative instance for\nFuture that runs each Future concurrently. Then when we traverse a List[A]\nwith an A =&gt; Future[B], we can imagine the traversal as a scatter-gather.\nEach A creates a concurrent computation that will produce a B (the scatter),\nand as the Futures complete they will be gathered back into a List.\nPlaying with Reader\nAnother interesting effect we can use is Reader. Recall that a Reader[E, A] is\na type alias for Kleisli[Id, E, A] which is a wrapper around E =&gt; A.\nIf we fix E to be some sort of environment or configuration, we can use the\nReader applicative in our traverse.\nimport cats.data.Reader\n\ntrait Context\ntrait Topic\ntrait Result\n\ntype Job[A] = Reader[Context, A]\n\ndef processTopic(topic: Topic): Job[Result] = ???\n\nWe can imagine we have a data pipeline that processes a bunch of data, each piece of data\nbeing categorized by a topic. Given a specific topic, we produce a Job that processes\nthat topic. (Note that since a Job is just a Reader/Kleisli, one could write many small\nJobs and compose them together into one Job that is used/returned by processTopic.)\nCorresponding to our bunches of data are bunches of topics, a List[Topic] if you will.\nSince Reader has an Applicative instance, we can traverse over this list with processTopic.\ndef processTopics(topics: List[Topic]) = \n  topics.traverse(processTopic)\n\nNote the nice return type - Job[List[Result]]. We now have one aggregate Job that when run,\nwill go through each topic and run the topic-specific job, collecting results as it goes.\nWe say &quot;when run&quot; because a Job is some function that requires a Context before producing\nthe value we want.\nOne example of a &quot;context&quot; can be found in the Spark project. In\nSpark, information needed to run a Spark job (where the master node is, memory allocated, etc.)\nresides in a SparkContext. Going back to the above example, we can see how one may define\ntopic-specific Spark jobs (type Job[A] = Reader[SparkContext, A]) and then run several\nSpark jobs on a collection of topics via traverse. We then get back a Job[List[Result]],\nwhich is equivalent to SparkContext =&gt; List[Result]. When finally passed a SparkContext,\nwe can run the job and get our results back.\nMoreover, the fact that our aggregate job is not tied to any specific SparkContext allows us\nto pass in a SparkContext pointing to a production cluster, or (using the exact same job) pass\nin a test SparkContext that just runs locally across threads. This makes testing our large\njob nice and easy.\nFinally, this encoding ensures that all the jobs for each topic run on the exact same cluster.\nAt no point do we manually pass in or thread a SparkContext through - that is taken care for us\nby the (applicative) effect of Reader and therefore by traverse.\nSequencing\nSometimes you may find yourself with a collection of data, each of which is already in an effect,\nfor instance a List[Option[A]]. To make this easier to work with, you want a Option[List[A]].\nGiven Option has an Applicative instance, we can traverse over the list with the identity function.\nimport cats.implicits._\n// import cats.implicits._\n\nval l1 = List(Option(1), Option(2), Option(3)).traverse(identity)\n// l1: Option[List[Int]] = Some(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nval l2 = List(Option(1), None, Option(3)).traverse(identity)\n// l2: Option[List[Int]] = None\n\nTraverse provides a convenience method sequence that does exactly this.\nval l1 = List(Option(1), Option(2), Option(3)).sequence\n// l1: Option[List[Int]] = Some(List(1, 2, 3))\n\nval l2 = List(Option(1), None, Option(3)).sequence\n// l2: Option[List[Int]] = None\n\nTraversing for effect\nSometimes our effectful functions return a Unit value in cases where there is no interesting value\nto return (e.g. writing to some sort of store).\ntrait Data\ndef writeToStore(data: Data): Future[Unit] = ???\n\nIf we traverse using this, we end up with a funny type.\nimport cats.implicits._\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\ndef writeManyToStore(data: List[Data]) =\n  data.traverse(writeToStore)\n\nWe end up with a Future[List[Unit]]! A List[Unit] is not of any use to us, and communicates the\nsame amount of information as a single Unit does.\nTraversing solely for the sake of the effect (ignoring any values that may be produced, Unit or otherwise)\nis common, so Foldable (superclass of Traverse) provides traverse_ and sequence_ methods that do the\nsame thing as traverse and sequence but ignores any value produced along the way, returning Unit at the end.\nimport cats.implicits._\n\ndef writeManyToStore(data: List[Data]) = \n  data.traverse_(writeToStore)\n\n// Int values are ignored with traverse_\ndef writeToStoreV2(data: Data): Future[Int] = \n  ???\n\ndef writeManyToStoreV2(data: List[Data]) = \n  data.traverse_(writeToStoreV2)\n\n"},"const.html":{"url":"const.html","title":"Const","body":"Const\nAt first glance Const seems like a strange data type - it has two type parameters, yet only\nstores a value of the first type.

It is of course desirable in many\ncases to get out members of other types, or to set them. In traditional object-oriented programming this is\nhandled by getter and setter methods on the outer object. In functional programming, a popular solution is\nto use a lens.\nA lens can be thought of as a first class getter/setter. A Lens[S, A] is a data type that knows how to get\nan A out of an S, or set an A in an S.\ntrait Lens[S, A] {\n  def get(s: S): A\n\n  def set(s: S, a: A): S\n\n  def modify(s: S)(f: A =&gt; A): S =\n    set(s, f(get(s)))\n}\n\nIt can be useful to have effectful modifications as well - perhaps our modification can fail (Option) or\ncan return several values (List).\ntrait Lens[S, A] {\n  def get(s: S): A\n\n  def set(s: S, a: A): S\n\n  def modify(s: S)(f: A =&gt; A): S =\n    set(s, f(get(s)))\n\n  def modifyOption(s: S)(f: A =&gt; Option[A]): Option[S] =\n    f(get(s)).map(a =&gt; set(s, a))\n\n  def modifyList(s: S)(f: A =&gt; List[A]): List[S] =\n    f(get(s)).map(a =&gt; set(s, a))\n}\n\nNote that both modifyOption and modifyList share the exact same implementation. If we look closely, the\nonly thing we need is a map operation on the data type. Being good functional programmers, we abstract.\nimport cats.Functor\nimport cats.implicits._\n\ntrait Lens[S, A] {\n  def get(s: S): A\n\n  def set(s: S, a: A): S\n\n  def modify(s: S)(f: A =&gt; A): S =\n    set(s, f(get(s)))\n\n  def modifyF[F[_] : Functor](s: S)(f: A =&gt; F[A]): F[S] =\n    f(get(s)).map(a =&gt; set(s, a))\n}\n\nWe can redefine modify in terms of modifyF by using cats.Id. We can also treat set as a modification\nthat simply ignores the current value. Due to these modifications however, we must leave modifyF abstract\nsince having it defined in terms of set would lead to infinite circular calls.\nimport cats.Id\n\ntrait Lens[S, A] {\n  def modifyF[F[_] : Functor](s: S)(f: A =&gt; F[A]): F[S]\n\n  def set(s: S, a: A): S = modify(s)(_ =&gt; a)\n\n  def modify(s: S)(f: A =&gt; A): S = modifyF[Id](s)(f)\n\n  def get(s: S): A\n}\n\nWhat about get? Certainly we can&#39;t define get in terms of the others.. the others are to modify an existing\nvalue, whereas get is to retrieve it. Let&#39;s give it a shot anyways.\nLooking at modifyF, we have an S we can pass in. The tricky part will be the A =&gt; F[A], and then somehow\ngetting an A out of F[S]. If we imagine F to be a type-level constant function however, we could imagine\nit would simply take any type and return some other constant type, an A perhaps. This suggests our F is a\nConst.\nWe then take a look at the fact that modifyF takes an F[_], a type constructor that takes a single type parameter.\nConst takes two, so we must fix one. The function returns an F[S], but we want an A, which implies we\nhave the first type parameter fixed to A and leave the second one free for the function to fill in as it wants.\nSubstituting in Const[A, _] wherever we see F[_], the function wants an A =&gt; Const[A, A] and will give us back\na Const[A, S]. Looking at the definition of Const, we see that we only ever have a value of the first type parameter\nand completely ignore the second. Therefore, we can treat any Const[X, Y] value as equivalent to X (plus or minus\nsome wrapping into Const). This leaves us with needing a function A =&gt; A. Given the type, the only thing we can do\nis to take an A and return it right back (lifted into Const).\nBefore we plug and play however, note that modifyF has a Functor constraint on F[_]. This means we need to\ndefine a Functor instance for Const, where the first type parameter is fixed.\nNote: the example below assumes usage of the kind-projector compiler plugin and will not compile if it is not being used in a project.\nimport cats.data.Const\n\nimplicit def constFunctor[X]: Functor[Const[X, ?]] =\n  new Functor[Const[X, ?]] {\n    // Recall Const[X, A] ~= X, so the function is not of any use to us\n    def map[A, B](fa: Const[X, A])(f: A =&gt; B): Const[X, B] =\n      Const(fa.getConst)\n  }\n\nNow that that&#39;s taken care of, let&#39;s substitute and see what happens.\ntrait Lens[S, A] {\n  def modifyF[F[_] : Functor](s: S)(f: A =&gt; F[A]): F[S]\n\n  def set(s: S, a: A): S = modify(s)(_ =&gt; a)\n\n  def modify(s: S)(f: A =&gt; A): S = modifyF[Id](s)(f)\n\n  def get(s: S): A = {\n    val storedValue = modifyF[Const[A, ?]](s)(a =&gt; Const(a))\n    storedValue.getConst\n  }\n}\n\nIt works! We get a Const[A, S] out on the other side, and we simply just retrieve the A value stored inside.\nWhat&#39;s going on here? We can treat the effectful &quot;modification&quot; we are doing as a store operation - we take an A\nand store it inside a Const. Knowing only F[_] has a Functor instance, it can only map over the Const\nwhich will do nothing to the stored value. After modifyF is done getting the new S, we retrieve the stored A\nvalue and we&#39;re done!\nExample 2: Traverse\nIn the popular The Essence of the Iterator Pattern\npaper, Jeremy Gibbons and Bruno C. d. S. Oliveria describe a functional approach to iterating over a collection of\ndata. Among the abstractions presented are Foldable and Traverse, replicated below (also available in Cats).\nimport cats.{Applicative, Monoid}\n\ntrait Foldable[F[_]] {\n  // Given a collection of data F[A], and a function mapping each A to a B where B has a Monoid instance,\n  // reduce the collection down to a single B value using the monoidal behavior of B\n  def foldMap[A, B : Monoid](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): B\n}\n\ntrait Traverse[F[_]] {\n  // Given a collection of data F[A], for each value apply the function f which returns an effectful\n  // value. The result of traverse is the composition of all these effectful values.\n  def traverse[G[_] : Applicative, A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; G[B]): G[F[B]]\n}\n\nThese two type classes seem unrelated - one reduces a collection down to a single value, the other traverses\na collection with an effectful function, collecting results. It may be surprising to see that in fact Traverse\nsubsumes Foldable.\ntrait Traverse[F[_]] extends Foldable[F] {\n  def traverse[G[_] : Applicative, A, X](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; G[X]): G[F[X]]\n\n  def foldMap[A, B : Monoid](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): B\n}\n\nTo start, we observe that if we are to implement foldMap in terms of traverse, we will want a B out\nat some point. However, traverse returns a G[F[X]]. It would seem there is no way to unify these two.\nHowever, if we imagine G[_] to be a sort of type-level constant function, where the fact that it&#39;s taking a\nF[X] is irrelevant to the true underlying value, we can begin to see how we might be able to pull this off.\ntraverse however wants G[_] to have an Applicative instance, so let&#39;s define one for Const. Since\nF[X] is the value we want to ignore, we treat it as the second type parameter and hence, leave it as the free\none.\nimport cats.data.Const\n\nimplicit def constApplicative[Z]: Applicative[Const[Z, ?]] =\n  new Applicative[Const[Z, ?]] {\n    def pure[A](a: A): Const[Z, A] = ???\n\n    def ap[A, B](f: Const[Z, A =&gt; B])(fa: Const[Z, A]): Const[Z, B] = ???\n  }\n\nRecall that Const[Z, A] means we have a Z value in hand, and don&#39;t really care about the A type parameter.\nTherefore we can more or less treat the type Const[Z, A] as just Z.\nIn functions pure and ap we have a problem. In pure, we have an A value, but want to return a Z value. We have\nno function A =&gt; Z, so our only option is to completely ignore the A value. But we still don&#39;t have a Z! Let&#39;s\nput that aside for now, but still keep it in the back of our minds.\nIn ap we have two Z values, and want to return a Z value. We could certainly return one or the other, but we\nshould try to do something more useful. This suggests composition of Zs, which we don&#39;t know how to do.\nSo now we need a constant Z value, and a binary function that takes two Zs and produces a Z. Sound familiar?\nWe want Z to have a Monoid instance!\nimplicit def constApplicative[Z : Monoid]: Applicative[Const[Z, ?]] =\n  new Applicative[Const[Z, ?]] {\n    def pure[A](a: A): Const[Z, A] = Const(Monoid[Z].empty)\n\n    def ap[A, B](f: Const[Z, A =&gt; B])(fa: Const[Z, A]): Const[Z, B] =\n      Const(Monoid[Z].combine(fa.getConst, f.getConst))\n  }\n\nWe have our Applicative!\nGoing back to Traverse, we fill in the first parameter of traverse with fa since that&#39;s\nthe only value that fits.\nNow we need a A =&gt; G[B]. We have an A =&gt; B, and we&#39;ve decided to use Const for our G[_]. We need to\nfix the first parameter of Const since Const takes two type parameters and traverse wants a type constructor\nwhich only takes one. The first type parameter which will be the type of the actual values we store, and therefore will\nbe the type of the value we get out at the end, so we leave the second one free, similar to the Applicative instance.\nWe don&#39;t care about the second type parameter and there are no restrictions on it, so we can just use Nothing,\nthe type that has no values.\nSo to summarize, what we want is a function A =&gt; Const[B, Nothing], and we have a function A =&gt; B. Recall\nthat Const[B, Z] (for any Z) is the moral equivalent of just B, so A =&gt; Const[B, Nothing] is equivalent\nto A =&gt; B, which is exactly what we have, we just need to wrap it.\ntrait Traverse[F[_]] extends Foldable[F] {\n  def traverse[G[_] : Applicative, A, X](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; G[X]): G[F[X]]\n\n  def foldMap[A, B : Monoid](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): B = {\n    val const: Const[B, F[Nothing]] = traverse[Const[B, ?], A, Nothing](fa)(a =&gt; Const(f(a)))\n    const.getConst\n  }\n}\n\nHurrah!\nWhat&#39;s happening here? We can see traverse is a function that goes over a collection, applying an\neffectful function to each value, and combining all of these effectful values. In our case, the effect\nis mapping each value to a value of type B, where we know how to combine Bs via its Monoid instance.\nThe Monoid instance is exactly what is used when traverse goes to collect the effectful values together.\nShould the F[A] be &quot;empty&quot;, it can use Monoid#empty as a value to return back.\nPretty nifty. traverse-ing over a collection with an effectful function is more general than traversing\nover a collection to reduce it down to a single value.\n"},"freeapplicative.html":{"url":"freeapplicative.html","title":"Freeapplicative","body":"Free Applicative\nFreeApplicatives are similar to Free (monads) in that they provide a nice way to represent\ncomputations as data and are useful for building embedded DSLs (EDSLs).

To make our program useful we need to interpret it.\nimport cats.Id\nimport cats.arrow.FunctionK\nimport cats.implicits._\n\n// a function that takes a string as input\ntype FromString[A] = String =&gt; A\n\nval compiler =\n  new FunctionK[ValidationOp, FromString] {\n    def apply[A](fa: ValidationOp[A]): String =&gt; A =\n      str =&gt;\n        fa match {\n          case Size(size) =&gt; str.size &gt;= size\n          case HasNumber  =&gt; str.exists(c =&gt; &quot;0123456789&quot;.contains(c))\n        }\n  }\n\nval validator = prog.foldMap[FromString](compiler)\n// validator: FromString[Boolean] = &lt;function1&gt;\n\nvalidator(&quot;1234&quot;)\n// res7: Boolean = false\n\nvalidator(&quot;12345&quot;)\n// res8: Boolean = true\n\nDifferences from Free\nSo far everything we&#39;ve been doing has been not much different from Free - we&#39;ve built\nan algebra and interpreted it. However, there are some things FreeApplicative can do that\nFree cannot.\nRecall a key distinction between the type classes Applicative and Monad - Applicative\ncaptures the idea of independent computations, whereas Monad captures that of dependent\ncomputations. Put differently Applicatives cannot branch based on the value of an existing/prior\ncomputation. Therefore when using Applicatives, we must hand in all our data in one go.\nIn the context of FreeApplicatives, we can leverage this static knowledge in our interpreter.\nParallelism\nBecause we have everything we need up front and know there can be no branching, we can easily\nwrite a validator that validates in parallel.\nimport cats.data.Kleisli\nimport cats.implicits._\nimport scala.concurrent.Future\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\n// recall Kleisli[Future, String, A] is the same as String =&gt; Future[A]\ntype ParValidator[A] = Kleisli[Future, String, A]\n\nval parCompiler =\n  new FunctionK[ValidationOp, ParValidator] {\n    def apply[A](fa: ValidationOp[A]): ParValidator[A] =\n      Kleisli { str =&gt;\n        fa match {\n          case Size(size) =&gt; Future { str.size &gt;= size }\n          case HasNumber  =&gt; Future { str.exists(c =&gt; &quot;0123456789&quot;.contains(c)) }\n        }\n      }\n  }\n\nval parValidation = prog.foldMap[ParValidator](parCompiler)\n\nLogging\nWe can also write an interpreter that simply creates a list of strings indicating the filters that\nhave been used - this could be useful for logging purposes. Note that we need not actually evaluate\nthe rules against a string for this, we simply need to map each rule to some identifier. Therefore\nwe can completely ignore the return type of the operation and return just a List[String] - the\nConst data type is useful for this.\nimport cats.data.Const\nimport cats.implicits._\n\ntype Log[A] = Const[List[String], A]\n\nval logCompiler =\n  new FunctionK[ValidationOp, Log] {\n    def apply[A](fa: ValidationOp[A]): Log[A] =\n      fa match {\n        case Size(size) =&gt; Const(List(s&quot;size &gt;= $size&quot;))\n        case HasNumber  =&gt; Const(List(&quot;has number&quot;))\n      }\n  }\n\ndef logValidation[A](validation: Validation[A]): List[String] =\n  validation.foldMap[Log](logCompiler).getConst\n\nlogValidation(prog)\n// res16: List[String] = List(size &gt;= 5, has number)\n\nlogValidation(size(5) *&gt; hasNumber *&gt; size(10))\n// res17: List[String] = List(size &gt;= 5, has number, size &gt;= 10)\n\nlogValidation((hasNumber |@| size(3)).map(_ || _))\n// res18: List[String] = List(has number, size &gt;= 3)\n\nWhy not both?\nIt is perhaps more plausible and useful to have both the actual validation function and the logging\nstrings. While we could easily compile our program twice, once for each interpreter as we have above,\nwe could also do it in one go - this would avoid multiple traversals of the same structure.\nAnother useful property Applicatives have over Monads is that given two Applicatives F[_] and\nG[_], their product type FG[A] = (F[A], G[A]) is also an Applicative. This is not true in the general\ncase for monads.\nTherefore, we can write an interpreter that uses the product of the ParValidator and Log Applicatives\nto interpret our program in one go.\nimport cats.data.Prod\n\ntype ValidateAndLog[A] = Prod[ParValidator, Log, A]\n\nval prodCompiler =\n  new FunctionK[ValidationOp, ValidateAndLog] {\n    def apply[A](fa: ValidationOp[A]): ValidateAndLog[A] = {\n      fa match {\n        case Size(size) =&gt;\n          val f: ParValidator[Boolean] = Kleisli(str =&gt; Future { str.size &gt;= size })\n          val l: Log[Boolean] = Const(List(s&quot;size &gt; $size&quot;))\n          Prod[ParValidator, Log, Boolean](f, l)\n        case HasNumber  =&gt;\n          val f: ParValidator[Boolean] = Kleisli(str =&gt; Future(str.exists(c =&gt; &quot;0123456789&quot;.contains(c))))\n          val l: Log[Boolean] = Const(List(&quot;has number&quot;))\n          Prod[ParValidator, Log, Boolean](f, l)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\nval prodValidation = prog.foldMap[ValidateAndLog](prodCompiler)\n\nReferences\nDeeper explanations can be found in this paper Free Applicative Functors by Paolo Capriotti\n"},"freemonad.html":{"url":"freemonad.html","title":"Freemonad","body":"Free Monad\nWhat is it?\nA free monad is a construction which allows you to build a monad\nfrom any Functor. Like other monads, it is a pure way to represent\nand manipulate computations.\nIn particular, free monads provide a practical way to:\n\nrepresent stateful computations as data, and run them\nrun recursive computations in a stack-safe way\nbuild an embedded DSL (domain-specific language)\nretarget a computation to another interpreter using natural transformations\n\n\n(In cats, the type representing a free monad is abbreviated as Free[_].)\n\nUsing Free Monads\nIf you&#39;d like to use cats&#39; free monad, you&#39;ll need to add a library dependency\nfor the cats-free module.\nA good way to get a sense for how free monads work is to see them in\naction. The next section uses Free[_] to create an embedded DSL\n(Domain Specific Language).\nIf you&#39;re interested in the theory behind free monads, the\nWhat is Free in theory? section discusses free monads\nin terms of category theory.\nStudy your topic\nLet&#39;s imagine that we want to create a DSL for a key-value store. We\nwant to be able to do three things with keys:\n\nput a value into the store, associated with its key.\nget a value from the store given its key.\ndelete a value from the store given its key.\n\nThe idea is to write a sequence of these operations in the embedded\nDSL as a &quot;program&quot;, compile the &quot;program&quot;, and finally execute the\n&quot;program&quot; to interact with the actual key-value store.\nFor example:\nput(&quot;toto&quot;, 3)\nget(&quot;toto&quot;) // returns 3\ndelete(&quot;toto&quot;)\n\nBut we want:\n\nthe computation to be represented as a pure, immutable value\nto separate the creation and execution of the program\nto be able to support many different methods of execution\n\nStudy your grammar\nWe have 3 commands to interact with our KeyValue store:\n\nPut a value associated with a key into the store\nGet a value associated with a key out of the store\nDelete a value associated with a key from the store\n\nCreate an ADT representing your grammar\nADT stands for Algebraic Data Type. In this context, it refers to a\nclosed set of types which can be combined to build up complex,\nrecursive values.\nWe need to create an ADT to represent our key-value operations:\nsealed trait KVStoreA[A]\ncase class Put[T](key: String, value: T) extends KVStoreA[Unit]\ncase class Get[T](key: String) extends KVStoreA[Option[T]]\ncase class Delete(key: String) extends KVStoreA[Unit]\n\nFree your ADT\nThere are six basic steps to &quot;freeing&quot; the ADT:\n\nCreate a type based on Free[_] and KVStoreA[_].\nCreate smart constructors for KVStore[_] using liftF.\nBuild a program out of key-value DSL operations.\nBuild a compiler for programs of DSL operations.\nExecute our compiled program.\n\n1. Create a Free type based on your ADT\nimport cats.free.Free\n\ntype KVStore[A] = Free[KVStoreA, A]\n\n2. Create smart constructors using liftF\nThese methods will make working with our DSL a lot nicer, and will\nlift KVStoreA[_] values into our KVStore[_] monad (note the\nmissing &quot;A&quot; in the second type).\nimport cats.free.Free.liftF\n\n// Put returns nothing (i.e. Unit).\ndef put[T](key: String, value: T): KVStore[Unit] =\n  liftF[KVStoreA, Unit](Put[T](key, value))\n\n// Get returns a T value.\ndef get[T](key: String): KVStore[Option[T]] =\n  liftF[KVStoreA, Option[T]](Get[T](key))\n\n// Delete returns nothing (i.e. Unit).\ndef delete(key: String): KVStore[Unit] =\n  liftF(Delete(key))\n\n// Update composes get and set, and returns nothing.\ndef update[T](key: String, f: T =&gt; T): KVStore[Unit] =\n  for {\n    vMaybe &lt;- get[T](key)\n    _ &lt;- vMaybe.map(v =&gt; put[T](key, f(v))).getOrElse(Free.pure(()))\n  } yield ()\n\n3. Build a program\nNow that we can construct KVStore[_] values we can use our DSL to\nwrite &quot;programs&quot; using a for-comprehension:\ndef program: KVStore[Option[Int]] =\n  for {\n    _ &lt;- put(&quot;wild-cats&quot;, 2)\n    _ &lt;- update[Int](&quot;wild-cats&quot;, (_ + 12))\n    _ &lt;- put(&quot;tame-cats&quot;, 5)\n    n &lt;- get[Int](&quot;wild-cats&quot;)\n    _ &lt;- delete(&quot;tame-cats&quot;)\n  } yield n\n\nThis looks like a monadic flow. However, it just builds a recursive\ndata structure representing the sequence of operations.\n4. Write a compiler for your program\nAs you may have understood now, Free[_] is used to create an embedded\nDSL. By itself, this DSL only represents a sequence of operations\n(defined by a recursive data structure); it doesn&#39;t produce anything.\nFree[_] is a programming language inside your programming language!\nSo, like any other programming language, we need to compile our\n  abstract language into an effective language and then run it.\nTo do this, we will use a natural transformation between type\ncontainers.  Natural transformations go between types like F[_] and\nG[_] (this particular transformation would be written as\nFunctionK[F,G] or as done here using the symbolic\nalternative as F ~&gt; G).\nIn our case, we will use a simple mutable map to represent our key\nvalue store:\nimport cats.arrow.FunctionK\nimport cats.{Id, ~&gt;}\nimport scala.collection.mutable\n\n// the program will crash if a key is not found,\n// or if a type is incorrectly specified.\ndef impureCompiler: KVStoreA ~&gt; Id  =\n  new (KVStoreA ~&gt; Id) {\n\n    // a very simple (and imprecise) key-value store\n    val kvs = mutable.Map.empty[String, Any]\n\n    def apply[A](fa: KVStoreA[A]): Id[A] =\n      fa match {\n        case Put(key, value) =&gt;\n          println(s&quot;put($key, $value)&quot;)\n          kvs(key) = value\n          ()\n        case Get(key) =&gt;\n          println(s&quot;get($key)&quot;)\n          kvs.get(key).map(_.asInstanceOf[A])\n        case Delete(key) =&gt;\n          println(s&quot;delete($key)&quot;)\n          kvs.remove(key)\n          ()\n      }\n  }\n\nPlease note this impureCompiler is impure -- it mutates kvs and\nalso produces logging output using println.  The whole purpose of\nfunctional programming isn&#39;t to prevent side-effects, it is just to\npush side-effects to the boundaries of your system in a well-known and\ncontrolled way.\nId[_] represents the simplest type container: the type itself. Thus,\nId[Int] is just Int. This means that our program will execute\nimmediately, and block until the final value can be returned.\nHowever, we could easily use other type containers for different\nbehavior, such as:\n\nFuture[_] for asynchronous computation\nList[_] for gathering multiple results\nOption[_] to support optional results\nXor[E, ?] to support failure\na pseudo-random monad to support non-determinism\nand so on...\n\n5. Run your program\nThe final step is naturally running your program after compiling it.\nFree[_] is just a recursive structure that can be seen as sequence\nof operations producing other operations. In this way it is similar to\nList[_]. We often use folds (e.g. foldRight) to obtain a single\nvalue from a list; this recurses over the structure, combining its\ncontents.\nThe idea behind running a Free[_] is exactly the same. We fold the\nrecursive structure by:\n\nconsuming each operation.\ncompiling the operation into our effective language using\nimpureCompiler (applying its effects if any).\ncomputing next operation.\ncontinue recursively until reaching a Pure state, and returning it.\n\nThis operation is called Free.foldMap:\nfinal def foldMap[M[_]](f: FunctionK[S,M])(M: Monad[M]): M[A] = ...\n\nM must be a Monad to be flattenable (the famous monoid aspect\nunder Monad). As Id is a Monad, we can use foldMap.\nTo run your Free with previous impureCompiler:\nval result: Option[Int] = program.foldMap(impureCompiler)\n// put(wild-cats, 2)\n// get(wild-cats)\n// put(wild-cats, 14)\n// put(tame-cats, 5)\n// get(wild-cats)\n// delete(tame-cats)\n// result: Option[Int] = Some(14)\n\nAn important aspect of foldMap is its stack-safety. It evaluates\neach step of computation on the stack then unstack and restart. This\nprocess is known as trampolining.\nAs long as your natural transformation is stack-safe, foldMap will\nnever overflow your stack.  Trampolining is heap-intensive but\nstack-safety provides the reliability required to use Free[_] for\ndata-intensive tasks, as well as infinite processes such as streams.\n7. Use a pure compiler (optional)\nThe previous examples used a effectful natural transformation. This\nworks, but you might prefer folding your Free in a &quot;purer&quot; way. The\nState data structure can be used to keep track of the program\nstate in an immutable map, avoiding mutation altogether.\nimport cats.data.State\n\ntype KVStoreState[A] = State[Map[String, Any], A]\nval pureCompiler: KVStoreA ~&gt; KVStoreState = new (KVStoreA ~&gt; KVStoreState) {\n  def apply[A](fa: KVStoreA[A]): KVStoreState[A] =\n    fa match {\n      case Put(key, value) =&gt; State.modify(_.updated(key, value))\n      case Get(key) =&gt;\n        State.inspect(_.get(key).map(_.asInstanceOf[A]))\n      case Delete(key) =&gt; State.modify(_ - key)\n    }\n}\n\n(You can see that we are again running into some places where Scala&#39;s\nsupport for pattern matching is limited by the JVM&#39;s type erasure, but\nit&#39;s not too hard to get around.)\nval result: (Map[String, Any], Option[Int]) = program.foldMap(pureCompiler).run(Map.empty).value\n// result: (Map[String,Any], Option[Int]) = (Map(wild-cats -&gt; 14),Some(14))\n\nComposing Free monads ADTs.\nReal world applications often time combine different algebras.\nThe Inject type class described by Swierstra in Data types à la carte\nlets us compose different algebras in the context of Free.\nLet&#39;s see a trivial example of unrelated ADT&#39;s getting composed as a Coproduct that can form a more complex program.\nimport cats.data.{Xor, Coproduct}\nimport cats.free.{Inject, Free}\nimport cats.{Id, ~&gt;}\nimport scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer\n\n/* Handles user interaction */\nsealed trait Interact[A]\ncase class Ask(prompt: String) extends Interact[String]\ncase class Tell(msg: String) extends Interact[Unit]\n\n/* Represents persistence operations */\nsealed trait DataOp[A]\ncase class AddCat(a: String) extends DataOp[Unit]\ncase class GetAllCats() extends DataOp[List[String]]\n\nOnce the ADTs are defined we can formally state that a Free program is the Coproduct of it&#39;s Algebras.\ntype CatsApp[A] = Coproduct[DataOp, Interact, A]\n\nIn order to take advantage of monadic composition we use smart constructors to lift our Algebra to the Free context.\nclass Interacts[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Interact, F]) {\n  def tell(msg: String): Free[F, Unit] = Free.inject[Interact, F](Tell(msg))\n  def ask(prompt: String): Free[F, String] = Free.inject[Interact, F](Ask(prompt))\n}\n\nobject Interacts {\n  implicit def interacts[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[Interact, F]): Interacts[F] = new Interacts[F]\n}\n\nclass DataSource[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[DataOp, F]) {\n  def addCat(a: String): Free[F, Unit] = Free.inject[DataOp, F](AddCat(a))\n  def getAllCats: Free[F, List[String]] = Free.inject[DataOp, F](GetAllCats())\n}\n\nobject DataSource {\n  implicit def dataSource[F[_]](implicit I: Inject[DataOp, F]): DataSource[F] = new DataSource[F]\n}\n\nADTs are now easily composed and trivially intertwined inside monadic contexts.\ndef program(implicit I : Interacts[CatsApp], D : DataSource[CatsApp]): Free[CatsApp, Unit] = {\n\n  import I._, D._\n\n  for {\n    cat &lt;- ask(&quot;What&#39;s the kitty&#39;s name?&quot;)\n    _ &lt;- addCat(cat)\n    cats &lt;- getAllCats\n    _ &lt;- tell(cats.toString)\n  } yield ()\n}\n\nFinally we write one interpreter per ADT and combine them with a FunctionK to Coproduct so they can be\ncompiled and applied to our Free program.\nobject ConsoleCatsInterpreter extends (Interact ~&gt; Id) {\n  def apply[A](i: Interact[A]) = i match {\n    case Ask(prompt) =&gt;\n      println(prompt)\n      readLine()\n    case Tell(msg) =&gt;\n      println(msg)\n  }\n}\n\nobject InMemoryDatasourceInterpreter extends (DataOp ~&gt; Id) {\n\n  private[this] val memDataSet = new ListBuffer[String]\n\n  def apply[A](fa: DataOp[A]) = fa match {\n    case AddCat(a) =&gt; memDataSet.append(a); ()\n    case GetAllCats() =&gt; memDataSet.toList\n  }\n}\n\nval interpreter: CatsApp ~&gt; Id = InMemoryDatasourceInterpreter or ConsoleCatsInterpreter\n\nNow if we run our program and type in &quot;snuggles&quot; when prompted, we see something like this:\nimport DataSource._, Interacts._\n\nval evaled: Unit = program.foldMap(interpreter)\n// What&#39;s the kitty&#39;s name?\n// List(snuggles)\n// evaled: Unit = ()\n\nFor the curious ones: what is Free in theory?\nMathematically-speaking, a free monad (at least in the programming\nlanguage context) is a construction that is left adjoint to a\nforgetful functor whose domain is the category of Monads and whose\nco-domain is the category of Endofunctors. Huh?\nConcretely, it is just a clever construction that allows us to build a\nvery simple Monad from any functor.\nThe above forgetful functor takes a Monad and:\n\nforgets its monadic part (e.g. the flatMap function)\nforgets its pointed part (e.g. the pure function)\nfinally keeps the functor part (e.g. the map function)\n\nBy reversing all arrows to build the left-adjoint, we deduce that the\nfree monad is basically a construction that:\n\ntakes a functor\nadds the pointed part (e.g. pure)\nadds the monadic behavior (e.g. flatMap)\n\nIn terms of implementation, to build a monad from a functor we use\nthe following classic inductive definition:\nsealed abstract class Free[F[_], A]\ncase class Pure[F[_], A](a: A) extends Free[F, A]\ncase class Suspend[F[_], A](a: F[Free[F, A]]) extends Free[F, A]\n\n(This generalizes the concept of fixed point functor.)\nIn this representation:\n\nPure builds a Free instance from an A value (it reifies the\npure function)\nSuspend build a new Free by applying F to a previous Free\n(it reifies the flatMap function)\n\nSo a typical Free structure might look like:\nSuspend(F(Suspend(F(Suspend(F(....(Pure(a))))))))\n\nFree is a recursive structure. It uses A in F[A] as the\nrecursion &quot;carrier&quot; with a terminal element Pure.\nFrom a computational point of view, Free recursive structure can be\nseen as a sequence of operations.\n\nPure returns an A value and ends the entire computation.\nSuspend is a continuation; it suspends the current computation\nwith the suspension functor F (which can represent a command for\nexample) and hands control to the caller. A represents a value\nbound to this computation.\n\nPlease note this Free construction has the interesting quality of\nencoding the recursion on the heap instead of the stack as classic\nfunction calls would. This provides the stack-safety we heard about\nearlier, allowing very large Free structures to be evaluated safely.\nFor the very curious ones\nIf you look at implementation in cats, you will see another member of\nthe Free[_] ADT:\nsealed abstract case class Gosub[S[_], B]() extends Free[S, B] {\n  type C\n  val a: () =&gt; Free[S, C]\n  val f: C =&gt; Free[S, B]\n}\n\nGosub represents a call to a subroutine a and when a is\nfinished, it continues the computation by calling the function f\nwith the result of a.\nIt is actually an optimization of Free structure allowing to solve a\nproblem of quadratic complexity implied by very deep recursive Free\ncomputations.\nIt is exactly the same problem as repeatedly appending to a List[_].\nAs the sequence of operations becomes longer, the slower a flatMap\n&quot;through&quot; the structure will be. With Gosub, Free becomes a\nright-associated structure not subject to quadratic complexity.\nFuture Work (TODO)\nThere are many remarkable uses of Free[_]. In the future, we will\ninclude some here, such as:\n\nTrampoline\nOption\nIteratee\nSource\netc...\n\nWe will also discuss the Coyoneda Trick.\nCredits\nThis article was written by\nPascal Voitot and edited by other\nmembers of the Cats community.\n"},"kleisli.html":{"url":"kleisli.html","title":"Kleisli","body":"Kleisli\nKleisli enables composition of functions that return a monadic value, for instance an Option[Int] \nor a Xor[String, List[Double]], without having functions take an Option or Xor as a parameter, \nwhich can be strange and unwieldy.\nWe may also have several functions which depend on some environment and want a nice way to compose these functions\nto ensure they all receive the same environment.

How do we\nhave these functions play nice with each other despite each only knowing about their own local requirements?\nThese situations are where Kleisli is immensely helpful.\nFunctions\nOne of the most useful properties of functions is that they compose. That is, given a function\nA =&gt; B and a function B =&gt; C, we can combine them to create a new function A =&gt; C. It is through\nthis compositional property that we are able to write many small functions and compose them together\nto create a larger one that suits our needs.\nval twice: Int =&gt; Int =\n  x =&gt; x * 2\n\nval countCats: Int =&gt; String =\n  x =&gt; if (x == 1) &quot;1 cat&quot; else s&quot;$x cats&quot;\n\nval twiceAsManyCats: Int =&gt; String =\n  twice andThen countCats // equivalent to: countCats compose twice\n\nThus.\ntwiceAsManyCats(1) // &quot;2 cats&quot;\n// res2: String = 2 cats\n\nSometimes, our functions will need to return monadic values. For instance, consider the following set of functions.\nval parse: String =&gt; Option[Int] =\n  s =&gt; if (s.matches(&quot;-?[0-9]+&quot;)) Some(s.toInt) else None\n\nval reciprocal: Int =&gt; Option[Double] =\n  i =&gt; if (i != 0) Some(1.0 / i) else None\n\nAs it stands we cannot use Function1.compose (or Function1.andThen) to compose these two functions.\nThe output type of parse is Option[Int] whereas the input type of reciprocal is Int.\nThis is where Kleisli comes into play.\nKleisli\nAt it&#39;s core, Kleisli[F[_], A, B] is just a wrapper around the function A =&gt; F[B]. Depending on the\nproperties of the F[_], we can do different things with Kleislis. For instance, if F[_] has a\nFlatMap[F] instance (we can call flatMap on F[A] values), we can\ncompose two Kleislis much like we can two functions.\nimport cats.FlatMap\nimport cats.implicits._\n\nfinal case class Kleisli[F[_], A, B](run: A =&gt; F[B]) {\n  def compose[Z](k: Kleisli[F, Z, A])(implicit F: FlatMap[F]): Kleisli[F, Z, B] =\n    Kleisli[F, Z, B](z =&gt; k.run(z).flatMap(run))\n}\n\nReturning to our earlier example:\n// Bring in cats.FlatMap[Option] instance\nimport cats.implicits._\n\nval parse = Kleisli((s: String) =&gt; try { Some(s.toInt) } catch { case _: NumberFormatException =&gt; None })\n\nval reciprocal = Kleisli((i: Int) =&gt; if (i == 0) None else Some(1.0 / i))\n\nval parseAndReciprocal = reciprocal.compose(parse)\n\nKleisli#andThen can be defined similarly.\nIt is important to note that the F[_] having a FlatMap (or a Monad) instance is not a hard requirement -\nwe can do useful things with weaker requirements. Such an example would be Kleisli#map, which only requires\nthat F[_] have a Functor instance (e.g. is equipped with map: F[A] =&gt; (A =&gt; B) =&gt; F[B]).\nimport cats.Functor\n\nfinal case class Kleisli[F[_], A, B](run: A =&gt; F[B]) {\n  def map[C](f: B =&gt; C)(implicit F: Functor[F]): Kleisli[F, A, C] =\n    Kleisli[F, A, C](a =&gt; F.map(run(a))(f))\n}\n\nBelow are some more methods on Kleisli that can be used so long as the constraint on F[_]\nis satisfied.\nMethod    | Constraint on `F[_]`\n--------- | -------------------\nandThen   | FlatMap\ncompose   | FlatMap\nflatMap   | FlatMap\nlower     | Monad\nmap       | Functor\ntraverse  | Applicative\nType class instances\nThe type class instances for Kleisli, like that for functions, often fix the input type (and the F[_]) and leave\nthe output type free. What type class instances it has tends to depend on what instances the F[_] has. For\ninstance, Kleisli[F, A, B] has a Functor instance so long as the chosen F[_] does. It has a Monad\ninstance so long as the chosen F[_] does. The instances in Cats are laid out in a way such that implicit\nresolution will pick up the most specific instance it can (depending on the F[_]).\nAn example of a Monad instance for Kleisli is shown below.\nNote: the example below assumes usage of the kind-projector compiler plugin and will not compile if it is not being used in a project.\nimport cats.implicits._\n\n// We can define a FlatMap instance for Kleisli if the F[_] we chose has a FlatMap instance\n// Note the input type and F are fixed, with the output type left free\nimplicit def kleisliFlatMap[F[_], Z](implicit F: FlatMap[F]): FlatMap[Kleisli[F, Z, ?]] =\n  new FlatMap[Kleisli[F, Z, ?]] {\n    def flatMap[A, B](fa: Kleisli[F, Z, A])(f: A =&gt; Kleisli[F, Z, B]): Kleisli[F, Z, B] =\n      Kleisli(z =&gt; fa.run(z).flatMap(a =&gt; f(a).run(z)))\n\n    def map[A, B](fa: Kleisli[F, Z, A])(f: A =&gt; B): Kleisli[F, Z, B] =\n      Kleisli(z =&gt; fa.run(z).map(f))\n  }\n\nBelow is a table of some of the type class instances Kleisli can have depending on what instances F[_] has.\nType class     | Constraint on `F[_]`\n-------------- | -------------------\nFunctor        | Functor\nApply          | Apply\nApplicative    | Applicative\nFlatMap        | FlatMap\nMonad          | Monad\nArrow          | Monad\nSplit          | FlatMap\nStrong         | Functor\nSemigroupK*    | FlatMap\nMonoidK*       | Monad\n*These instances only exist for Kleisli arrows with identical input and output types; that is, \nKleisli[F, A, A] for some type A. These instances use Kleisli composition as the combine operation,\nand Monad.pure as the empty value.\nAlso, there is an instance of Monoid[Kleisli[F, A, B]] if there is an instance of Monoid[F[B]]. \nMonoid.combine here creates a new Kleisli arrow which takes an A value and feeds it into each \nof the combined Kleisli arrows, which together return two F[B] values. Then, they are combined into one \nusing the Monoid[F[B]] instance.\nOther uses\nMonad Transformers\nMany data types have a monad transformer equivalent that allows us to compose the Monad instance of the data\ntype with any other Monad instance. For instance, OptionT[F[_], A] allows us to compose the monadic properties\nof Option with any other F[_], such as a List. This allows us to work with nested contexts/effects in a\nnice way (for example, in for-comprehensions).\nKleisli can be viewed as the monad transformer for functions. Recall that at its essence, Kleisli[F, A, B]\nis just a function A =&gt; F[B], with niceties to make working with the value we actually care about, the B, easy.\nKleisli allows us to take the effects of functions and have them play nice with the effects of any other F[_].\nThis may raise the question, what exactly is the &quot;effect&quot; of a function?\nWell, if we take a look at any function, we can see it takes some input and produces some output with it, without\nhaving touched the input (assuming the function is pure, i.e.\nreferentially transparent).\nThat is, we take a read-only value, and produce some value with it. For this reason, the type class instances for\nfunctions often refer to the function as a Reader. For instance, it is common to hear about the Reader monad.\nIn the same spirit, Cats defines a Reader type alias along the lines of:\n// We want A =&gt; B, but Kleisli provides A =&gt; F[B]. To make the types/shapes match,\n// we need an F[_] such that providing it a type A is equivalent to A\n// This can be thought of as the type-level equivalent of the identity function\ntype Id[A] = A\n\ntype Reader[A, B] = Kleisli[Id, A, B]\nobject Reader {\n  // Lifts a plain function A =&gt; B into a Kleisli, giving us access\n  // to all the useful methods and type class instances\n  def apply[A, B](f: A =&gt; B): Reader[A, B] = Kleisli[Id, A, B](f)\n}\n\ntype ReaderT[F[_], A, B] = Kleisli[F, A, B]\nval ReaderT = Kleisli\n\nThe ReaderT value alias exists to allow users to use the Kleisli companion object as if it were ReaderT, if\nthey were so inclined.\nThe topic of functions as a read-only environment brings us to our next common use case of Kleisli - configuration.\nConfiguration\nFunctional programming advocates the creation of programs and modules by composing smaller, simpler modules. This\nphilosophy intentionally mirrors that of function composition - write many small functions, and compose them\nto build larger ones. After all, our programs are just functions.\nLet&#39;s look at some example modules, where each module has it&#39;s own configuration that is validated by a function.\nIf the configuration is good, we return a Some of the module, otherwise a None. This example uses Option for\nsimplicity - if you want to provide error messages or other failure context, consider using Xor instead.\ncase class DbConfig(url: String, user: String, pass: String)\ntrait Db\nobject Db {\n  val fromDbConfig: Kleisli[Option, DbConfig, Db] = ???\n}\n\ncase class ServiceConfig(addr: String, port: Int)\ntrait Service\nobject Service {\n  val fromServiceConfig: Kleisli[Option, ServiceConfig, Service] = ???\n}\n\nWe have two independent modules, a Db (allowing access to a database) and a Service (supporting an API to provide\ndata over the web). Both depend on their own configuration parameters. Neither know or care about the other, as it\nshould be. However our application needs both of these modules to work. It is plausible we then have a more global\napplication configuration.\ncase class AppConfig(dbConfig: DbConfig, serviceConfig: ServiceConfig)\n\nclass App(db: Db, service: Service)\n\nAs it stands, we cannot use both Kleisli validation functions together nicely - one takes a DbConfig, the\nother a ServiceConfig. That means the FlatMap (and by extension, the Monad) instances differ (recall the\ninput type is fixed in the type class instances). However, there is a nice function on Kleisli called local.\nfinal case class Kleisli[F[_], A, B](run: A =&gt; F[B]) {\n  def local[AA](f: AA =&gt; A): Kleisli[F, AA, B] = Kleisli(f.andThen(run))\n}\n\nWhat local allows us to do is essentially &quot;expand&quot; our input type to a more &quot;general&quot; one. In our case, we\ncan take a Kleisli that expects a DbConfig or ServiceConfig and turn it into one that expects an AppConfig,\nso long as we tell it how to go from an AppConfig to the other configs.\nNow we can create our application config validator!\nfinal case class Kleisli[F[_], Z, A](run: Z =&gt; F[A]) {\n  def flatMap[B](f: A =&gt; Kleisli[F, Z, B])(implicit F: FlatMap[F]): Kleisli[F, Z, B] =\n    Kleisli(z =&gt; F.flatMap(run(z))(a =&gt; f(a).run(z)))\n\n  def map[B](f: A =&gt; B)(implicit F: Functor[F]): Kleisli[F, Z, B] =\n    Kleisli(z =&gt; F.map(run(z))(f))\n\n  def local[ZZ](f: ZZ =&gt; Z): Kleisli[F, ZZ, A] = Kleisli(f.andThen(run))\n}\n\ncase class DbConfig(url: String, user: String, pass: String)\ntrait Db\nobject Db {\n  val fromDbConfig: Kleisli[Option, DbConfig, Db] = ???\n}\n\ncase class ServiceConfig(addr: String, port: Int)\ntrait Service\nobject Service {\n  val fromServiceConfig: Kleisli[Option, ServiceConfig, Service] = ???\n}\n\ncase class AppConfig(dbConfig: DbConfig, serviceConfig: ServiceConfig)\n\nclass App(db: Db, service: Service)\n\ndef appFromAppConfig: Kleisli[Option, AppConfig, App] =\n  for {\n    db &lt;- Db.fromDbConfig.local[AppConfig](_.dbConfig)\n    sv &lt;- Service.fromServiceConfig.local[AppConfig](_.serviceConfig)\n  } yield new App(db, sv)\n\nWhat if we need a module that doesn&#39;t need any config validation, say a strategy to log events? We would have such a\nmodule be instantiated from a config directly, without an Option - we would have something like\nKleisli[Id, LogConfig, Log] (alternatively, Reader[LogConfig, Log]). However, this won&#39;t play nice with our other\nKleislis since those use Option instead of Id.\nWe can define a lift method on Kleisli (available already on Kleisli in Cats) that takes a type parameter G[_]\nsuch that G has an Applicative instance and lifts a Kleisli value such that its output type is G[F[B]]. This\nallows us to then lift a Reader[A, B] into a Kleisli[G, A, B]. Note that lifting a Reader[A, B] into some G[_]\nis equivalent to having a Kleisli[G, A, B] since Reader[A, B] is just a type alias for Kleisli[Id, A, B], and\ntype Id[A] = A so G[Id[A]] is equivalent to G[A].\n"},"oneand.html":{"url":"oneand.html","title":"Oneand","body":"OneAnd\nThe OneAnd[F[_],A] data type represents a single element of type A\nthat is guaranteed to be present (head) and in addition to this a\nsecond part that is wrapped inside an higher kinded type constructor\nF[_].

Speaking technically, it is a monad transformer for Option, but you don&#39;t need to know what that means for it to be useful. OptionT can be more convenient to work with than using F[Option[A]] directly.\nReduce map boilerplate\nConsider the following scenario:\nimport scala.concurrent.Future\nimport scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global\n\nval customGreeting: Future[Option[String]] = Future.successful(Some(&quot;welcome back, Lola&quot;))\n\nWe want to try out various forms of our greetings.\nval excitedGreeting: Future[Option[String]] = customGreeting.map(_.map(_ + &quot;!&quot;))\n\nval hasWelcome: Future[Option[String]] = customGreeting.map(_.filter(_.contains(&quot;welcome&quot;)))\n\nval noWelcome: Future[Option[String]] = customGreeting.map(_.filterNot(_.contains(&quot;welcome&quot;)))\n\nval withFallback: Future[String] = customGreeting.map(_.getOrElse(&quot;hello, there!&quot;))\n\nAs you can see, the implementations of all of these variations are very similar. We want to call the Option operation (map, filter, filterNot, getOrElse), but since our Option is wrapped in a Future, we first need to map over the Future.\nOptionT can help remove some of this boilerplate. It exposes methods that look like those on Option, but it handles the outer map call on the Future so we don&#39;t have to:\nimport cats.data.OptionT\nimport cats.implicits._\n\nval customGreetingT: OptionT[Future, String] = OptionT(customGreeting)\n\nval excitedGreeting: OptionT[Future, String] = customGreetingT.map(_ + &quot;!&quot;)\n\nval withWelcome: OptionT[Future, String] = customGreetingT.filter(_.contains(&quot;welcome&quot;))\n\nval noWelcome: OptionT[Future, String] = customGreetingT.filterNot(_.contains(&quot;welcome&quot;))\n\nval withFallback: Future[String] = customGreetingT.getOrElse(&quot;hello, there!&quot;)\n\nFrom Option[A] and/or F[A] to OptionT[F, A]\nSometimes you may have an Option[A] and/or F[A] and want to lift them into an OptionT[F, A]. For this purpose OptionT exposes two useful methods, namely fromOption and liftF, respectively. E.g.:\nval greetingFO: Future[Option[String]] = Future.successful(Some(&quot;Hello&quot;))\n\nval firstnameF: Future[String] = Future.successful(&quot;Jane&quot;)\n\nval lastnameO: Option[String] = Some(&quot;Doe&quot;)\n\nval ot: OptionT[Future, String] = for {\n  g &lt;- OptionT(greetingFO)\n  f &lt;- OptionT.liftF(firstnameF)\n  l &lt;- OptionT.fromOption[Future](lastnameO)\n} yield s&quot;$g $f $l&quot;\n\nval result: Future[Option[String]] = ot.value // Future(Some(&quot;Hello Jane Doe&quot;))\n\nFrom A to OptionT[F,A]\nIf you have only an A and you wish to lift it into an OptionT[F,A] assuming you have an Applicative instance for F you can use some which is an alias for pure. There also exists a none method which can be used to create an OptionT[F,A], where the Option wrapped A type is actually a None:\nval greet: OptionT[Future,String] = OptionT.pure(&quot;Hola!&quot;)\n\nval greetAlt: OptionT[Future,String] = OptionT.some(&quot;Hi!&quot;)\n\nval failedGreet: OptionT[Future,String] = OptionT.none\n\nBeyond map\nSometimes the operation you want to perform on an Future[Option[String]] might not be as simple as just wrapping the Option method in a Future.map call. For example, what if we want to greet the customer with their custom greeting if it exists but otherwise fall back to a default Future[String] greeting? Without OptionT, this implementation might look like:\nval defaultGreeting: Future[String] = Future.successful(&quot;hello, there&quot;)\n\nval greeting: Future[String] = customGreeting.flatMap(custom =&gt;\n  custom.map(Future.successful).getOrElse(defaultGreeting))\n\nWe can&#39;t quite turn to the getOrElse method on OptionT, because it takes a default value of type A instead of Future[A]. However, the getOrElseF method is exactly what we want:\nval greeting: Future[String] = customGreetingT.getOrElseF(defaultGreeting)\n\nGetting to the underlying instance\nIf you want to get the F[Option[A]] value (in this case Future[Option[String]]) out of an OptionT instance, you can simply call  value:\nval customGreeting: Future[Option[String]] = customGreetingT.value\n\n"},"state.html":{"url":"state.html","title":"State","body":"State\nState is a structure that provides a functional approach to handling application state. State[S, A] is basically a function S =&gt; (S, A), where S is the type that represents your state and A is the result the function produces. In addition to returning the result of type A, the function returns a new S value, which is the updated state.\nRobots\nLet&#39;s try to make this more concrete with an example. We have this Robot model:\nfinal case class Robot(\n  id: Long,\n  sentient: Boolean,\n  name: String,\n  model: String)\n\nWe would like to generate some random Robot instances for test data.\nPseudorandom values\nScala&#39;s standard library has a built-in Random class that provides a (pseudo)random number generator (RNG). Let&#39;s use it to write a method that creates robots.\nval rng = new scala.util.Random(0L)\n\ndef createRobot(): Robot = {\n  val id = rng.nextLong()\n  val sentient = rng.nextBoolean()\n  val isCatherine = rng.nextBoolean()\n  val name = if (isCatherine) &quot;Catherine&quot; else &quot;Carlos&quot;\n  val isReplicant = rng.nextBoolean()\n  val model = if (isReplicant) &quot;replicant&quot; else &quot;borg&quot;\n  Robot(id, sentient, name, model)\n}\n\nval robot = createRobot()\n// robot: Robot = Robot(-4962768465676381896,false,Catherine,replicant)\n\nWe create a single Random instance, which is mutated as a side-effect each time that we call nextLong or nextBoolean on it. This mutation makes it more difficult to reason about our code. Someone might come along and see that we have rng.nextBoolean repeated three times within a single method. They might cleverly avoid repeated code and method invocations by extracting the common code into a variable:\nval rng = new scala.util.Random(0L)\n\ndef createRobot(): Robot = {\n  val id = rng.nextLong()\n  val b = rng.nextBoolean()\n  val sentient = b\n  val isCatherine = b\n  val name = if (isCatherine) &quot;Catherine&quot; else &quot;Carlos&quot;\n  val isReplicant = b\n  val model = if (isReplicant) &quot;replicant&quot; else &quot;borg&quot;\n  Robot(id, sentient, name, model)\n}\n\nval robot = createRobot()\n// robot: Robot = Robot(-4962768465676381896,false,Carlos,borg)\n\nBut now the output of our program has changed! We used to have a replicant robot named Catherine, but now we have a borg robot named Carlos. It might not have been obvious, but the nextBoolean calls we were making had the side effect of mutating internal RNG state, and we were depending on that behavior.\nWhen we can&#39;t freely refactor identical code into a common variable, the code becomes harder to reason about. In functional programming lingo, one might say that such code lacks referential transparency).\nPurely functional pseudorandom values\nSince mutating state caused us trouble, let&#39;s create an RNG that is immutable.\nWe&#39;ll use a simple RNG that can generate pseudorandom Long values based only on the previous &quot;seed&quot; value and some carefully chosen constants. You don&#39;t need to understand the details of this implementation for the purposes of this example, but if you&#39;d like to know more, this is Knuth&#39;s 64-bit linear congruential generator.\nfinal case class Seed(long: Long) {\n  def next = Seed(long * 6364136223846793005L + 1442695040888963407L)\n}\n\nInstead of mutating the existing long value, calling next returns a new Seed instance with an updated long value.\nSince the RNG isn&#39;t updating state internally, we will need to keep track of state outside of the RNG. When we call nextBoolean we will want it to return a Boolean as it did before, but we will also want it to return an updated Seed that we can use to generate our next random value.\n  def nextBoolean(seed: Seed): (Seed, Boolean) =\n    (seed.next, seed.long &gt;= 0L)\n\nSimilarly, nextLong will return an updated Seed along with a Long value.\n  def nextLong(seed: Seed): (Seed, Long) =\n    (seed.next, seed.long)\n\nNow we need to explicitly pass in the updated state as we generate each new value.\ndef createRobot(seed: Seed): Robot = {\n  val (seed1, id) = nextLong(seed)\n  val (seed2, sentient) = nextBoolean(seed1)\n  val (seed3, isCatherine) = nextBoolean(seed2)\n  val name = if (isCatherine) &quot;Catherine&quot; else &quot;Carlos&quot;\n  val (seed4, isReplicant) = nextBoolean(seed3)\n  val model = if (isReplicant) &quot;replicant&quot; else &quot;borg&quot;\n  Robot(id, sentient, name, model)\n}\n\nval initialSeed = Seed(13L)\n\nval robot = createRobot(initialSeed)\n// robot: Robot = Robot(13,false,Catherine,replicant)\n\nNow it is a bit more obvious that we can&#39;t extract the three nextBoolean calls into a single variable, because we are passing each one a different seed value.\nHowever, it is a bit cumbersome to explicitly pass around all of this intermediate state. It&#39;s also a bit error-prone. It would have been easy to accidentally call nextBoolean(seed2) for both the name generation and the model generation, instead of remembering to use nextBoolean(seed3) the second time.\nCleaning it up with State\nState&#39;s special power is keeping track of state and passing it along. Recall the description of State at the beginning of this document. It is basically a function S =&gt; (S, A), where S is a type representing state.\nOur nextLong function takes a Seed and returns an updated Seed and a Long. It can be represented as Seed =&gt; (Seed, Long), and therefore matches the pattern S =&gt; (S, A) where S is Seed and A is Long.\nLet&#39;s write a new version of nextLong using State:\nimport cats.data.State\n\nval nextLong: State[Seed, Long] = State(seed =&gt;\n  (seed.next, seed.long))\n\nThe map method on State allows us to transform the A value without affecting the S (state) value. This is perfect for implementing nextBoolean in terms of nextLong.\nval nextBoolean: State[Seed, Boolean] = nextLong.map(long =&gt;\n  long &gt; 0)\n\nThe flatMap method on State[S, A] lets you use the result of one State in a subsequent State. The updated state (S) after the first call is passed into the second call. These flatMap and map methods allow us to use State in for-comprehensions:\nval createRobot: State[Seed, Robot] =\n  for {\n    id &lt;- nextLong\n    sentient &lt;- nextBoolean\n    isCatherine &lt;- nextBoolean\n    name = if (isCatherine) &quot;Catherine&quot; else &quot;Carlos&quot;\n    isReplicant &lt;- nextBoolean\n    model = if (isReplicant) &quot;replicant&quot; else &quot;borg&quot;\n  } yield Robot(id, sentient, name, model)\n\nAt this point, we have not yet created a robot; we have written instructions for creating a robot. We need to pass in an initial seed value, and then we can call value to actually create the robot:\nval (finalState, robot) = createRobot.run(initialSeed).value\n// finalState: Seed = Seed(2999987205171331217)\n// robot: Robot = Robot(13,false,Catherine,replicant)\n\nIf we only care about the robot and not the final state, then we can use runA:\nval robot = createRobot.runA(initialSeed).value\n// robot: Robot = Robot(13,false,Catherine,replicant)\n\nThe createRobot implementation reads much like the imperative code we initially wrote for the mutable RNG. However, this implementation is free of mutation and side-effects. Since this code is referentially transparent, we can perform the refactoring that we tried earlier without affecting the result:\nval createRobot: State[Seed, Robot] = {\n  val b = nextBoolean\n\n  for {\n    id &lt;- nextLong\n    sentient &lt;- b\n    isCatherine &lt;- b\n    name = if (isCatherine) &quot;Catherine&quot; else &quot;Carlos&quot;\n    isReplicant &lt;- b\n    model = if (isReplicant) &quot;replicant&quot; else &quot;borg&quot;\n  } yield Robot(id, sentient, name, model)\n}\n\nval robot = createRobot.runA(initialSeed).value\n// robot: Robot = Robot(13,false,Catherine,replicant)\n\nThis may seem surprising, but keep in mind that b isn&#39;t simply a Boolean. It is a function that takes a seed and returns a Boolean, threading state along the way. Since the seed that is being passed into b changes from line to line, so do the returned Boolean values.\nFine print\nTODO explain StateT and the fact that State is an alias for StateT with Eval.\n"},"validated.html":{"url":"validated.html","title":"Validated","body":"Validated\nImagine you are filling out a web form to signup for an account.

Parsing will be handled by a Read type class - we provide instances\njust for String and Int for brevity.\ntrait Read[A] {\n  def read(s: String): Option[A]\n}\n\nobject Read {\n  def apply[A](implicit A: Read[A]): Read[A] = A\n\n  implicit val stringRead: Read[String] =\n    new Read[String] { def read(s: String): Option[String] = Some(s) }\n\n  implicit val intRead: Read[Int] =\n    new Read[Int] {\n      def read(s: String): Option[Int] =\n        if (s.matches(&quot;-?[0-9]+&quot;)) Some(s.toInt)\n        else None\n    }\n}\n\nThen we enumerate our errors - when asking for a config value, one of two things can\ngo wrong: the field is missing, or it is not well-formed with regards to the expected\ntype.\nsealed abstract class ConfigError\nfinal case class MissingConfig(field: String) extends ConfigError\nfinal case class ParseError(field: String) extends ConfigError\n\nWe need a data type that can represent either a successful value (a parsed configuration),\nor an error.\nsealed abstract class Validated[+E, +A]\n\nobject Validated {\n  final case class Valid[+A](a: A) extends Validated[Nothing, A]\n  final case class Invalid[+E](e: E) extends Validated[E, Nothing]\n}\n\nNow we are ready to write our parser.\nimport cats.data.Validated\nimport cats.data.Validated.{Invalid, Valid}\n\ncase class Config(map: Map[String, String]) {\n  def parse[A : Read](key: String): Validated[ConfigError, A] =\n    map.get(key) match {\n      case None        =&gt; Invalid(MissingConfig(key))\n      case Some(value) =&gt;\n        Read[A].read(value) match {\n          case None    =&gt; Invalid(ParseError(key))\n          case Some(a) =&gt; Valid(a)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nEverything is in place to write the parallel validator. Recall that we can only do parallel\nvalidation if each piece is independent. How do we enforce the data is independent? By asking\nfor all of it up front. Let&#39;s start with two pieces of data.\ndef parallelValidate[E, A, B, C](v1: Validated[E, A], v2: Validated[E, B])(f: (A, B) =&gt; C): Validated[E, C] =\n  (v1, v2) match {\n    case (Valid(a), Valid(b))       =&gt; Valid(f(a, b))\n    case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_))   =&gt; i\n    case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_))   =&gt; i\n    case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) =&gt; ???\n  }\n\nWe&#39;ve run into a problem. In the case where both have errors, we want to report both. But we have\nno way of combining the two errors into one error! Perhaps we can put both errors into a List,\nbut that seems needlessly specific - clients may want to define their own way of combining errors.\nHow then do we abstract over a binary operation? The Semigroup type class captures this idea.\nimport cats.Semigroup\n\ndef parallelValidate[E : Semigroup, A, B, C](v1: Validated[E, A], v2: Validated[E, B])(f: (A, B) =&gt; C): Validated[E, C] =\n  (v1, v2) match {\n    case (Valid(a), Valid(b))       =&gt; Valid(f(a, b))\n    case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_))   =&gt; i\n    case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_))   =&gt; i\n    case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) =&gt; Invalid(Semigroup[E].combine(e1, e2))\n  }\n\nPerfect! But.. going back to our example, we don&#39;t have a way to combine ConfigErrors. But as clients,\nwe can change our Validated values where the error can be combined, say, a List[ConfigError]. It is\nmore common however to use a NonEmptyList[ConfigError] - the NonEmptyList statically guarantees we\nhave at least one value, which aligns with the fact that if we have an Invalid, then we most\ncertainly have at least one error. This technique is so common there is a convenient method on Validated\ncalled toValidatedNel that turns any Validated[E, A] value to a Validated[NonEmptyList[E], A].\nAdditionally, the type alias ValidatedNel[E, A] is provided.\nTime to parse.\nimport cats.SemigroupK\nimport cats.data.NonEmptyList\nimport cats.implicits._\n\ncase class ConnectionParams(url: String, port: Int)\n\nval config = Config(Map((&quot;endpoint&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;), (&quot;port&quot;, &quot;not an int&quot;)))\n\nimplicit val nelSemigroup: Semigroup[NonEmptyList[ConfigError]] =\n  SemigroupK[NonEmptyList].algebra[ConfigError]\n\nimplicit val readString: Read[String] = Read.stringRead\nimplicit val readInt: Read[Int] = Read.intRead\n\nAny and all errors are reported!\nval v1 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String](&quot;url&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                          config.parse[Int](&quot;port&quot;).toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)\n// v1: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.NonEmptyList[ConfigError],ConnectionParams] = Invalid(OneAnd(MissingConfig(url),List(ParseError(port))))\n\nval v2 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String](&quot;endpoint&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                          config.parse[Int](&quot;port&quot;).toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)\n// v2: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.NonEmptyList[ConfigError],ConnectionParams] = Invalid(OneAnd(ParseError(port),List()))\n\nval config = Config(Map((&quot;endpoint&quot;, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;), (&quot;port&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;)))\n// config: Config = Config(Map(endpoint -&gt; 127.0.0.1, port -&gt; 1234))\n\nval v3 = parallelValidate(config.parse[String](&quot;endpoint&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                          config.parse[Int](&quot;port&quot;).toValidatedNel)(ConnectionParams.apply)\n// v3: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.NonEmptyList[ConfigError],ConnectionParams] = Valid(ConnectionParams(127.0.0.1,1234))\n\nApply\nOur parallelValidate function looks awfully like the Apply#map2 function.\ndef map2[F[_], A, B, C](fa: F[A], fb: F[B])(f: (A, B) =&gt; C): F[C]\n\nWhich can be defined in terms of Apply#ap and Apply#map, the very functions needed to create an Apply instance.\nCan we perhaps define an Apply instance for Validated? Better yet, can we define an Applicative instance?\nNote: the example below assumes usage of the kind-projector compiler plugin and will not compile if it is not being used in a project.\nimport cats.Applicative\n\nimplicit def validatedApplicative[E : Semigroup]: Applicative[Validated[E, ?]] =\n  new Applicative[Validated[E, ?]] {\n    def ap[A, B](f: Validated[E, A =&gt; B])(fa: Validated[E, A]): Validated[E, B] =\n      (fa, f) match {\n        case (Valid(a), Valid(fab)) =&gt; Valid(fab(a))\n        case (i@Invalid(_), Valid(_)) =&gt; i\n        case (Valid(_), i@Invalid(_)) =&gt; i\n        case (Invalid(e1), Invalid(e2)) =&gt; Invalid(Semigroup[E].combine(e1, e2))\n      }\n\n    def pure[A](x: A): Validated[E, A] = Validated.valid(x)\n  }\n\nAwesome! And now we also get access to all the goodness of Applicative, which includes map{2-22}, as well as the\nCartesian syntax |@|.\nWe can now easily ask for several bits of configuration and get any and all errors returned back.\nimport cats.Apply\nimport cats.data.ValidatedNel\n\nimplicit val nelSemigroup: Semigroup[NonEmptyList[ConfigError]] =\n  SemigroupK[NonEmptyList].algebra[ConfigError]\n\nval config = Config(Map((&quot;name&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;), (&quot;age&quot;, &quot;not a number&quot;), (&quot;houseNumber&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;), (&quot;lane&quot;, &quot;feline street&quot;)))\n\ncase class Address(houseNumber: Int, street: String)\ncase class Person(name: String, age: Int, address: Address)\n\nThus.\nval personFromConfig: ValidatedNel[ConfigError, Person] =\n  Apply[ValidatedNel[ConfigError, ?]].map4(config.parse[String](&quot;name&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                                           config.parse[Int](&quot;age&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                                           config.parse[Int](&quot;house_number&quot;).toValidatedNel,\n                                           config.parse[String](&quot;street&quot;).toValidatedNel) {\n    case (name, age, houseNumber, street) =&gt; Person(name, age, Address(houseNumber, street))\n  }\n// personFromConfig: cats.data.ValidatedNel[ConfigError,Person] = Invalid(OneAnd(MissingConfig(street),List(MissingConfig(house_number), ParseError(age))))\n\nOf flatMaps and Xors\nOption has flatMap, Xor has flatMap, where&#39;s Validated&#39;s? Let&#39;s try to implement it - better yet,\nlet&#39;s implement the Monad type class.\nimport cats.Monad\n\nimplicit def validatedMonad[E]: Monad[Validated[E, ?]] =\n  new Monad[Validated[E, ?]] {\n    def flatMap[A, B](fa: Validated[E, A])(f: A =&gt; Validated[E, B]): Validated[E, B] =\n      fa match {\n        case Valid(a)     =&gt; f(a)\n        case i@Invalid(_) =&gt; i\n      }\n\n    def pure[A](x: A): Validated[E, A] = Valid(x)\n  }\n\nNote that all Monad instances are also Applicative instances, where ap is defined as\ntrait Monad[F[_]] {\n  def flatMap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; F[B]): F[B]\n  def pure[A](x: A): F[A]\n\n  def map[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: A =&gt; B): F[B] =\n    flatMap(fa)(f.andThen(pure))\n\n  def ap[A, B](fa: F[A])(f: F[A =&gt; B]): F[B] =\n    flatMap(fa)(a =&gt; map(f)(fab =&gt; fab(a)))\n}\n\nHowever, the ap behavior defined in terms of flatMap does not behave the same as that of\nour ap defined above. Observe:\nval v = validatedMonad.tuple2(Validated.invalidNel[String, Int](&quot;oops&quot;), Validated.invalidNel[String, Double](&quot;uh oh&quot;))\n// v: cats.data.Validated[cats.data.NonEmptyList[String],(Int, Double)] = Invalid(OneAnd(oops,List()))\n\nThis one short circuits! Therefore, if we were to define a Monad (or FlatMap) instance for Validated we would\nhave to override ap to get the behavior we want. But then the behavior of flatMap would be inconsistent with\nthat of ap, not good. Therefore, Validated has only an Applicative instance.\nValidated vs Xor\nWe&#39;ve established that an error-accumulating data type such as Validated can&#39;t have a valid Monad instance. Sometimes the task at hand requires error-accumulation. However, sometimes we want a monadic structure that we can use for sequential validation (such as in a for-comprehension). This leaves us in a bit of a conundrum.\nCats has decided to solve this problem by using separate data structures for error-accumulation (Validated) and short-circuiting monadic behavior (Xor).\nIf you are trying to decide whether you want to use Validated or Xor, a simple heuristic is to use Validated if you want error-accumulation and to otherwise use Xor.\nSequential Validation\nIf you do want error accumulation but occasionally run into places where you sequential validation is needed, then Validated provides a couple methods that may be helpful.\nandThen\nThe andThen method is similar to flatMap (such as Xor.flatMap). In the cause of success, it passes the valid value into a function that returns a new Validated instance.\nval houseNumber = config.parse[Int](&quot;house_number&quot;).andThen{ n =&gt;\n   if (n &gt;= 0) Validated.valid(n)\n   else Validated.invalid(ParseError(&quot;house_number&quot;))\n}\n// houseNumber: cats.data.Validated[ConfigError,Int] = Invalid(MissingConfig(house_number))\n\nwithXor\nThe withXor method allows you to temporarily turn a Validated instance into an Xor instance and apply it to a function.\nimport cats.data.Xor\n\ndef positive(field: String, i: Int): ConfigError Xor Int = {\n  if (i &gt;= 0) Xor.right(i)\n  else Xor.left(ParseError(field))\n}\n\nThus.\nval houseNumber = config.parse[Int](&quot;house_number&quot;).withXor{ xor: ConfigError Xor Int =&gt;\n  xor.flatMap{ i =&gt;\n    positive(&quot;house_number&quot;, i)\n  }\n}\n// houseNumber: cats.data.Validated[ConfigError,Int] = Invalid(MissingConfig(house_number))\n\n"},"xor.html":{"url":"xor.html","title":"Xor","body":"Xor\nIn day-to-day programming, it is fairly common to find ourselves writing functions that\ncan fail. For instance, querying a service may result in a connection issue, or some\nunexpected JSON response.\nTo communicate these errors it has become common practice to throw exceptions. However,\nexceptions are not tracked in any way, shape, or form by the Scala compiler. To see\nwhat kind of exceptions (if any) a function may throw, we have to dig through the source code.\nThen to handle these exceptions, we have to make sure we catch them at the call site.\nThis all becomes even more unwieldy when we try to compose exception-throwing procedures.\nval throwsSomeStuff: Int =&gt; Double = ???\n\nval throwsOtherThings: Double =&gt; String = ???\n\nval moreThrowing: String =&gt; List[Char] = ???\n\nval magic = throwsSomeStuff.andThen(throwsOtherThings).andThen(moreThrowing)\n\nAssume we happily throw exceptions in our code. Looking at the types, any of those functions\ncan throw any number of exceptions, we don&#39;t know. When we compose, exceptions from any of\nthe constituent functions can be thrown. Moreover, they may throw the same kind of exception\n(e.g. IllegalArgumentException) and thus it gets tricky tracking exactly where that\nexception came from.\nHow then do we communicate an error? By making it explicit in the data type we return.\nXor\nXor vs Validated\nIn general, Validated is used to accumulate errors, while Xor is used to short-circuit a computation upon the first error. For more information, see the Validated vs Xor section of the Validated documentation.\nWhy not Either\nXor is very similar to scala.util.Either - in fact, they are isomorphic (that is,\nany Either value can be rewritten as an Xor value, and vice versa).\nsealed abstract class Xor[+A, +B]\n\nobject Xor {\n  final case class Left[+A](a: A) extends Xor[A, Nothing]\n  final case class Right[+B](b: B) extends Xor[Nothing, B]\n}\n\nJust like Either, it has two type parameters. Instances of Xor either hold a value\nof one type parameter, or the other. Why then does it exist at all?\nTaking a look at Either, we notice it lacks flatMap and map methods. In order to map\nover an Either[A, B] value, we have to state which side we want to map over. For example,\nif we want to map Either[A, B] to Either[A, C] we would need to map over the right side.\nThis can be accomplished by using the Either#right method, which returns a RightProjection\ninstance. RightProjection does have flatMap and map on it, which acts on the right side\nand ignores the left - this property is referred to as &quot;right-bias.&quot;\nval e1: Either[String, Int] = Right(5)\n// e1: Either[String,Int] = Right(5)\n\ne1.right.map(_ + 1)\n// res0: Product with Serializable with scala.util.Either[String,Int] = Right(6)\n\nval e2: Either[String, Int] = Left(&quot;hello&quot;)\n// e2: Either[String,Int] = Left(hello)\n\ne2.right.map(_ + 1)\n// res1: Product with Serializable with scala.util.Either[String,Int] = Left(hello)\n\nNote the return types are themselves back to Either, so if we want to make more calls to\nflatMap or map then we again must call right or left.\nMore often than not we want to just bias towards one side and call it a day - by convention,\nthe right side is most often chosen. This is the primary difference between Xor and Either -\nXor is right-biased. Xor also has some more convenient methods on it, but the most\ncrucial one is the right-biased being built-in.\nimport cats.data.Xor\n// import cats.data.Xor\n\nval xor1: Xor[String, Int] = Xor.right(5)\n// xor1: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Right(5)\n\nxor1.map(_ + 1)\n// res2: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Right(6)\n\nval xor2: Xor[String, Int] = Xor.left(&quot;hello&quot;)\n// xor2: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Left(hello)\n\nxor2.map(_ + 1)\n// res3: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Left(hello)\n\nBecause Xor is right-biased, it is possible to define a Monad instance for it. You\ncould also define one for Either but due to how it&#39;s encoded it may seem strange to fix a\nbias direction despite it intending to be flexible in that regard. The Monad instance for\nXor is consistent with the behavior of the data type itself, whereas the one for Either\nwould only introduce bias when Either is used in a generic context (a function abstracted\nover M[_] : Monad).\nSince we only ever want the computation to continue in the case of Xor.Right (as captured\nby the right-bias nature), we fix the left type parameter and leave the right one free.\nNote: the example below assumes usage of the kind-projector compiler plugin and will not compile if it is not being used in a project.\nimport cats.Monad\n\nimplicit def xorMonad[Err]: Monad[Xor[Err, ?]] =\n  new Monad[Xor[Err, ?]] {\n    def flatMap[A, B](fa: Xor[Err, A])(f: A =&gt; Xor[Err, B]): Xor[Err, B] =\n      fa.flatMap(f)\n\n    def pure[A](x: A): Xor[Err, A] = Xor.right(x)\n  }\n\nExample usage: Round 1\nAs a running example, we will have a series of functions that will parse a string into an integer,\ntake the reciprocal, and then turn the reciprocal into a string.\nIn exception-throwing code, we would have something like this:\nobject ExceptionStyle {\n  def parse(s: String): Int =\n    if (s.matches(&quot;-?[0-9]+&quot;)) s.toInt\n    else throw new NumberFormatException(s&quot;${s} is not a valid integer.&quot;)\n\n  def reciprocal(i: Int): Double =\n    if (i == 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Cannot take reciprocal of 0.&quot;)\n    else 1.0 / i\n\n  def stringify(d: Double): String = d.toString\n}\n\nInstead, let&#39;s make the fact that some of our functions can fail explicit in the return type.\nobject XorStyle {\n  def parse(s: String): Xor[NumberFormatException, Int] =\n    if (s.matches(&quot;-?[0-9]+&quot;)) Xor.right(s.toInt)\n    else Xor.left(new NumberFormatException(s&quot;${s} is not a valid integer.&quot;))\n\n  def reciprocal(i: Int): Xor[IllegalArgumentException, Double] =\n    if (i == 0) Xor.left(new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Cannot take reciprocal of 0.&quot;))\n    else Xor.right(1.0 / i)\n\n  def stringify(d: Double): String = d.toString\n}\n\nNow, using combinators like flatMap and map, we can compose our functions together.\nimport XorStyle._\n\ndef magic(s: String): Xor[Exception, String] =\n  parse(s).flatMap(reciprocal).map(stringify)\n\nWith the composite function that we actually care about, we can pass in strings and then pattern\nmatch on the exception. Because Xor is a sealed type (often referred to as an algebraic data type,\nor ADT), the compiler will complain if we do not check both the Left and Right case.\nmagic(&quot;123&quot;) match {\n  case Xor.Left(_: NumberFormatException) =&gt; println(&quot;not a number!&quot;)\n  case Xor.Left(_: IllegalArgumentException) =&gt; println(&quot;can&#39;t take reciprocal of 0!&quot;)\n  case Xor.Left(_) =&gt; println(&quot;got unknown exception&quot;)\n  case Xor.Right(s) =&gt; println(s&quot;Got reciprocal: ${s}&quot;)\n}\n// Got reciprocal: 0.008130081300813009\n\nNot bad - if we leave out any of those clauses the compiler will yell at us, as it should. However,\nnote the Xor.Left(_) clause - the compiler will complain if we leave that out because it knows\nthat given the type Xor[Exception, String], there can be inhabitants of Xor.Left that are not\nNumberFormatException or IllegalArgumentException. However, we &quot;know&quot; by inspection of the source\nthat those will be the only exceptions thrown, so it seems strange to have to account for other exceptions.\nThis implies that there is still room to improve.\nExample usage: Round 2\nInstead of using exceptions as our error value, let&#39;s instead enumerate explicitly the things that\ncan go wrong in our program.\nobject XorStyle {\n  sealed abstract class Error\n  final case class NotANumber(string: String) extends Error\n  final case object NoZeroReciprocal extends Error\n\n  def parse(s: String): Xor[Error, Int] =\n    if (s.matches(&quot;-?[0-9]+&quot;)) Xor.right(s.toInt)\n    else Xor.left(NotANumber(s))\n\n  def reciprocal(i: Int): Xor[Error, Double] =\n    if (i == 0) Xor.left(NoZeroReciprocal)\n    else Xor.right(1.0 / i)\n\n  def stringify(d: Double): String = d.toString\n\n  def magic(s: String): Xor[Error, String] =\n    parse(s).flatMap(reciprocal).map(stringify)\n}\n\nFor our little module, we enumerate any and all errors that can occur. Then, instead of using\nexception classes as error values, we use one of the enumerated cases. Now when we pattern\nmatch, we get much nicer matching. Moreover, since Error is sealed, no outside code can\nadd additional subtypes which we might fail to handle.\nimport XorStyle._\n// import XorStyle._\n\nmagic(&quot;123&quot;) match {\n  case Xor.Left(NotANumber(_)) =&gt; println(&quot;not a number!&quot;)\n  case Xor.Left(NoZeroReciprocal) =&gt; println(&quot;can&#39;t take reciprocal of 0!&quot;)\n  case Xor.Right(s) =&gt; println(s&quot;Got reciprocal: ${s}&quot;)\n}\n// Got reciprocal: 0.008130081300813009\n\nXor in the small, Xor in the large\nOnce you start using Xor for all your error-handling, you may quickly run into an issue where\nyou need to call into two separate modules which give back separate kinds of errors.\nsealed abstract class DatabaseError\ntrait DatabaseValue\n\nobject Database {\n  def databaseThings(): Xor[DatabaseError, DatabaseValue] = ???\n}\n\nsealed abstract class ServiceError\ntrait ServiceValue\n\nobject Service {\n  def serviceThings(v: DatabaseValue): Xor[ServiceError, ServiceValue] = ???\n}\n\nLet&#39;s say we have an application that wants to do database things, and then take database\nvalues and do service things. Glancing at the types, it looks like flatMap will do it.\ndef doApp = Database.databaseThings().flatMap(Service.serviceThings)\n\nThis doesn&#39;t work! Well, it does, but it gives us Xor[Object, ServiceValue] which isn&#39;t\nparticularly useful for us. Now if we inspect the Lefts, we have no clue what it could be.\nThe reason this occurs is because the first type parameter in the two Xors are different -\ndatabaseThings() can give us a DatabaseError whereas serviceThings() can give us a\nServiceError: two completely unrelated types. Recall that the type parameters of Xor\nare covariant, so when it sees an Xor[E1, A1] and an Xor[E2, A2], it will happily try\nto unify the E1 and E2 in a flatMap call - in our case, the closest common supertype is\nObject, leaving us with practically no type information to use in our pattern match.\nSolution 1: Application-wide errors\nSo clearly in order for us to easily compose Xor values, the left type parameter must be the same.\nWe may then be tempted to make our entire application share an error data type.\nsealed abstract class AppError\nfinal case object DatabaseError1 extends AppError\nfinal case object DatabaseError2 extends AppError\nfinal case object ServiceError1 extends AppError\nfinal case object ServiceError2 extends AppError\n\ntrait DatabaseValue\n\nobject Database {\n  def databaseThings(): Xor[AppError, DatabaseValue] = ???\n}\n\nobject Service {\n  def serviceThings(v: DatabaseValue): Xor[AppError, ServiceValue] = ???\n}\n\ndef doApp = Database.databaseThings().flatMap(Service.serviceThings)\n\nThis certainly works, or at least it compiles. But consider the case where another module wants to just use\nDatabase, and gets an Xor[AppError, DatabaseValue] back. Should it want to inspect the errors, it\nmust inspect all the AppError cases, even though it was only intended for Database to use\nDatabaseError1 or DatabaseError2.\nSolution 2: ADTs all the way down\nInstead of lumping all our errors into one big ADT, we can instead keep them local to each module, and have\nan application-wide error ADT that wraps each error ADT we need.\nsealed abstract class DatabaseError\ntrait DatabaseValue\n\nobject Database {\n  def databaseThings(): Xor[DatabaseError, DatabaseValue] = ???\n}\n\nsealed abstract class ServiceError\ntrait ServiceValue\n\nobject Service {\n  def serviceThings(v: DatabaseValue): Xor[ServiceError, ServiceValue] = ???\n}\n\nsealed abstract class AppError\nobject AppError {\n  final case class Database(error: DatabaseError) extends AppError\n  final case class Service(error: ServiceError) extends AppError\n}\n\nNow in our outer application, we can wrap/lift each module-specific error into AppError and then\ncall our combinators as usual. Xor provides a convenient method to assist with this, called Xor.leftMap -\nit can be thought of as the same as map, but for the Left side.\ndef doApp: Xor[AppError, ServiceValue] =\n  Database.databaseThings().leftMap(AppError.Database).\n  flatMap(dv =&gt; Service.serviceThings(dv).leftMap(AppError.Service))\n\nHurrah! Each module only cares about its own errors as it should be, and more composite modules have their\nown error ADT that encapsulates each constituent module&#39;s error ADT. Doing this also allows us to take action\non entire classes of errors instead of having to pattern match on each individual one.\ndef awesome =\n  doApp match {\n    case Xor.Left(AppError.Database(_)) =&gt; &quot;something in the database went wrong&quot;\n    case Xor.Left(AppError.Service(_))  =&gt; &quot;something in the service went wrong&quot;\n    case Xor.Right(_)                   =&gt; &quot;everything is alright!&quot;\n  }\n\nWorking with exception-y code\nThere will inevitably come a time when your nice Xor code will have to interact with exception-throwing\ncode. Handling such situations is easy enough.\nval xor: Xor[NumberFormatException, Int] =\n  try {\n    Xor.right(&quot;abc&quot;.toInt)\n  } catch {\n    case nfe: NumberFormatException =&gt; Xor.left(nfe)\n  }\n// xor: cats.data.Xor[NumberFormatException,Int] = Left(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;)\n\nHowever, this can get tedious quickly. Xor provides a catchOnly method on its companion object\nthat allows you to pass it a function, along with the type of exception you want to catch, and does the\nabove for you.\nval xor: Xor[NumberFormatException, Int] =\n  Xor.catchOnly[NumberFormatException](&quot;abc&quot;.toInt)\n// xor: cats.data.Xor[NumberFormatException,Int] = Left(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;)\n\nIf you want to catch all (non-fatal) throwables, you can use catchNonFatal.\nval xor: Xor[Throwable, Int] =\n  Xor.catchNonFatal(&quot;abc&quot;.toInt)\n// xor: cats.data.Xor[Throwable,Int] = Left(java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: &quot;abc&quot;)\n\nAdditional syntax\nimport cats.implicits._\n// import cats.implicits._\n\nval xor3: Xor[String, Int] = 7.right[String]\n// xor3: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Right(7)\n\nval xor4: Xor[String, Int] = &quot;hello 🐈s&quot;.left[Int]\n// xor4: cats.data.Xor[String,Int] = Left(hello 🐈s)\n\n"},"CONTRIBUTING.html":{"url":"CONTRIBUTING.html","title":"Contributing","body":"Contributor guide\nDiscussion around Cats is currently happening in the\nGitter channel as well as on Github\nissue and PR pages.

If you don&#39;t have the time to go through every step,\ncontribute what you can, and someone else will probably be happy to\nfollow up with any polishing that may need to be done.\nIf you want to touch up some documentation or fix typos, feel free to\nskip these steps and jump straight to submitting a pull request.\n\nFind something that belongs in cats\nLet us know you are working on it\nImplement your contribution\nWrite tests\nWrite documentation\nWrite examples\nSubmit pull request\n\nFind something that belongs in cats\nLooking for a way that you can help out? Check out our\nWaffle.io page. Choose a card from the\n&quot;Ready&quot; column. Before you start working on it, make sure that it&#39;s\nnot already assigned to someone and that nobody has left a comment\nsaying that they are working on it!\n(Of course, you can also comment on an issue someone is already\nworking on and offer to collaborate.)\nHave an idea for something new? That&#39;s great! We recommend that you\nmake sure it belongs in cats before you put effort into creating a\npull request. The preferred ways to do that are to either:\n\ncreate a GitHub issue\ndescribing your idea.\nget feedback in the cats Gitter room.\n\nThings that belong in cats generally have the following characteristics:\n\nTheir behavior is governed by well-defined laws.\nThey provide general abstractions.\n\nLaws help keep types consistent, and remove ambiguity or sensitivity\nabout how particular instances can behave. We&#39;ve found that types with\nlaws are often more useful than lawless types\n(In some cases, lawless type classes and instances are useful. We\nintend to support some of these in a future module.)\nBy staying general, Cats&#39; abstractions are widely-applicable, and not\ntied to particular libraries or strategies. Rather than being a\nlibrary to work with databases, HTTP requests, etc, Cats provides\nabstractions used to build those libraries.\nCats (and especially cats-core) is intended to be lean and modular.\nSome great ideas are not a great fit, either due to their size or\ntheir complexity. In these cases, creating your own library that\ndepends on Cats is probably the best plan.\nLet us know you are working on it\nIf there is already a GitHub issue for the task you are working on,\nleave a comment to let people know that you are working on it. If\nthere isn&#39;t already an issue and it is a non-trivial task, it&#39;s a good\nidea to create one (and note that you&#39;re working on it). This prevents\ncontributors from duplicating effort.\nWrite code\nTODO\nShould this just link to a separate doc? This might get large.\nWrite about implicit params as discussed in https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/27\nWrite about type class methods on data structures as described in https://github.com/typelevel/cats/issues/25\nWrite about https://github.com/typelevel/cats/pull/36#issuecomment-72892359\nWrite tests\n\nTests for cats-core go into the tests module, under the cats.tests package.\nTests for additional modules, such as &#39;jvm&#39;, go into the tests directory within that module.\nCats tests should extend CatsSuite.  CatsSuite integrates ScalaTest\nwith Discipline for law checking, and imports all syntax and standard instances for convenience.\nThe first parameter to the checkAll method provided by\nDiscipline, is the name of the test and will be output to the\nconsole as part of the test execution. By convention:\nWhen checking laws, this parameter generally takes a form that describes the data type being tested.\nFor example the name &quot;Validated[String, Int]&quot; might be used when testing a type class instance\nthat the Validated data type supports.\nAn exception to this is serializability tests, where the type class name is also included in the name.\nFor example, in the case of Validated, the serializability test would take the form,\n&quot;Applicative[Validated[String, Int]&quot;, to indicate that this test is verifying that the Applicative \ntype class instance for the Validated data type is serializable.\nThis convention helps to ensure clear and easy to understand output, with minimal duplication in the output.\n\n\nIt is also a goal that, for every combination of data type and supported type class instance:\nAppropriate law checks for that combination are included to ensure that the instance meets the laws for that type class.\nA serializability test for that combination is also included, such that we know that frameworks which\nrely heavily on serialization, such as Spark, will have strong compatibility with cats.\nNote that custom serialization tests are not required for instances of type classes which come from\nalgebra, such as Monoid, because the algebra laws include a test for serialization.\n\n\n\nTODO\nWrite about checking laws\nContributing documentation\nSource for the documentation\nThe documentation for this website is stored alongside the source, in the docs subproject.\n\nThe source for the static pages is in docs/src/site\nThe source for the tut compiled pages is in docs/src/main/tut\n\nGenerating the Site\nrun sbt docs/makeSite\nPreviewing the site\n\nInstall jekyll locally, depending on your platform, you might do this with:\n yum install jekyll\n apt-get install jekyll\n gem install jekyll\n\nIn a shell, navigate to the generated site directory in docs/target/site\n\nStart jekyll with jekyll serve\n\nNavigate to http://localhost:4000/cats/ in your browser\n\nMake changes to your site, and run sbt makeSite to regenerate the site.

Squashing and rebasing can lead to a tidier git history, but they can also be a hassle if somebody else has done work based on your branch.\nHow did we do?\nGetting involved in an open source project can be tough. As a\nnewcomer, you may not be familiar with coding style conventions,\nproject layout, release cycles, etc. This document seeks to demystify\nthe contribution process for the cats project.\nIt may take a while to familiarize yourself with this document, but if\nwe are doing our job right, you shouldn&#39;t have to spend months poring\nover the project source code or lurking the\nGitter room before you feel comfortable\ncontributing. In fact, if you encounter any confusion or frustration\nduring the contribution process, please create a GitHub issue and\nwe&#39;ll do our best to improve the process.\n"},"PROCESS.html":{"url":"PROCESS.html","title":"Process","body":"Process\nIntroduction\nThis document is intended to help consolidate the practices we are\nusing to develop and maintain Cats. Its primary audience is Cats\nmaintainers who may need to close issues, merge PRs, do releases, or\nunderstand how these things work.\nMerging pull requests\nPull requests currently require two sign-offs from Cats\nmaintainers. Community member sign-offs are appreciated as votes of\nconfidence but don&#39;t usually count toward this total unless the\ncommenter has already been involved with the area of code in question.\nWhen fixing typos or improving documentation only one sign-off is\nrequired (although for major edits waiting for two may be preferable).\nFor serious emergencies or work on the build which can&#39;t easily be\nreviewed or tested, pushing directly to master may be OK (but is\ndefinitely not encouraged). In these cases it&#39;s best to comment in\nGitter or elsewhere about what happened and what was done.\nVersioning\nIf a release is simply a bug fix, increment the patch version number\n(e.g. 1.2.3 becomes 1.2.4). These releases may happen quite quickly in\nresponse to reported bugs or problems, and should usually be source\nand binary compatible.\nIf the major version is 0, then the minor version should be updated\n(e.g. 0.2.3 becomes 0.3.0). There are no compatibility guarantees for\nthis type of change.\nIf the major version is 1 or greater, then significant additions\nshould increment the minor version number (e.g. 1.2.3 becomes 1.3.0)\nand breaking or incompatible changes should increment the major number\n(e.g. 1.2.3 becomes 2.0.0). These major version bumps should only\noccur after substantial review, warning, and with proper deprecation\ncycles.\nReleasing\nBefore the release, the tests and other validation must be passing.\nCurrently, the best way to release cats is:\n\nRun + clean to ensure a clean start.\nRun + package to ensure everything builds.\nRun release, which will validate tests/code, etc.\n\n(Eventually release should do all of these things but for now the\nindividual steps are necessary.)\nYou will need to enter a GPG password to sign the artifacts correctly,\nand you will also need to have Sonatype credentials to publish the\nartifacts. The release process should take care of everything,\nincluding releasing the artifacts on Sonatype.\nIf the Sonatype publishing fails, but the artifacts were uploaded, you\ncan finish the release manually using the Sonatype web site. In that\ncase you will also need to do git push --tags origin master to push\nthe new version&#39;s tags.\n(In the future we may want to create branches for major versions,\ne.g. v1.x. For now we don&#39;t have these.)\nPost-release\nAfter the release occurs, you will need to update the\ndocumentation. Here is a list of the places that will definitely need\nto be updated:\n\ndocs/src/site/index.md: update version numbers\nREADME.md: update version numbers\nAUTHORS.md: add new contributors\nCHANGES.md: summarize changes since last release\n\n(Other changes may be necessary, especially for large releases.)\nYou can get a list of changes between release tags v0.1.2 and\nv0.2.0 via git log v0.1.2..v0.2.0. Scanning this list of commit\nmessages is a good way to get a summary of what happened, although it\ndoes not account for conversations that occured on Github.\nOnce the relevant documentation changes have been committed, new\nrelease notes should be\nadded. You can add a release by clicking the &quot;Draft a new release&quot; button\non that page, or if the relevant release already exists, you can click\n&quot;Edit release&quot;.\nThe website should then be updated via sbt docs/ghpagesPushSite.\nConclusion\nIdeally this document will evolve and grow as the project\nmatures. Pull requests to add sections explaining how maintenance\noccurs (or should occur) are very welcome.\n"},"AUTHORS.html":{"url":"AUTHORS.html","title":"Authors","body":"Authors\nA successful open-source project relies upon the community to:\n\ndiscuss requirements and possible designs\nsubmit code and tests\nidentify and fix bugs\ncreate documentation and examples\nprovide feedback\nsupport each other\n\nThis file lists the people whose contributions have made Cats\npossible:\n\n3rdLaw\nAaron Levin\nAdelbert Chang\nAldo Stracquadanio\nAlessandro Lacava\nAlexey Levan\nAlissa Pajer\nAlistair Johnson\nAmir Mohammad Saied\nAndrew Jones\nAngelo Genovese\nAntoine Comte\nArya Irani\nAsh Pook\nAλ\nBenjamin Thuillier\nBinh Nguyen\nBobby Rauchenberg\nBrendan McAdams\nCody Allen\nColt Frederickson\nDale Wijnand\nDaniel Spiewak\nDave Gurnell\nDave Rostron\nDavid Allsopp\nDavid Gregory\nDenis Mikhaylov\nDerek Wickern\nEdmund Noble\nErik LaBianca\nErik Osheim\nEugene Burmako\nEugene Yokota\nFeynman Liang\nFrank S.

Update URLs\n\nVersion 0.4.0\n\n2016 February 1\n\nVersion 0.4.0 is the fourth release of the Cats library, and the first release\npublished under the org.typelevel group from the\nTypelevel organization on GitHub (previous\nreleases had been published to org.spire-math from non/cats). This means\nthat users will need to change the groupId for their Cats dependencies when\nupdating. If you have a line like this in your SBT build configuration, for\nexample:\nlibraryDependencies += &quot;org.spire-math&quot; %% &quot;cats&quot; % &quot;0.3.0&quot;\n\nYou will need to change it to the following:\nlibraryDependencies += &quot;org.typelevel&quot; %% &quot;cats&quot; % &quot;0.4.0&quot;\n\nThis release no longer includes cats-state or cats-free artifacts, since\nthe cats.state and cats.free packages have been moved into cats-core.\nIf you&#39;ve checked out the GitHub repository locally, it would be a good idea to\nupdate your remote to point to the new organization, which will typically look\nlike this (note that you should confirm that origin is the appropriate\nremote name):\ngit remote set-url origin git@github.com:typelevel/cats.git\n\nThis release includes a large number of breaking changes, including most\nprominently the introduction of a new Cartesian type class that is a supertype\nof Monad (and many other types). If you use the |@| syntax that had\npreviously been provided by Apply, you&#39;ll need to change your imports from\ncats.syntax.apply._ to cats.syntax.cartesian._. For example:\nscala&gt; import cats.Eval, cats.syntax.cartesian._\nimport cats.Eval\nimport cats.syntax.cartesian._\n\nscala&gt; (Eval.now(&quot;v&quot;) |@| Eval.now(0.4)).tupled\nres0: cats.Eval[(String, Double)] = cats.Eval$$anon$5@104f8bbd\n\nOther changes in this release are described below.\nThis version includes API changes:\n\n#555: |@| syntax is now\nprovided by

0.3.0\n\n2015 November 8\n\nVersion 0.3.0 is the third release of the Cats library.\nThis version includes new type class instances:\n\n#545: Semigroup instances for\nOneAnd\n#521: Monoid instances for Xor\nwhen the left side has a Semigroup instance and the right side has a\nMonoid\n#497: Monoid instances for Set\n#559: Bifunctor instances for\nValidated, Ior, Xor, and XorT\n#569: Functor instances for\nOptionT when F has a Functor instance but not a Monad\n#600: Show instances for Option\nand OptionT\n#601: Show instances for List\n#602: Show instances for Set\n#568: Several new Unapply shapes\n\nAnd API changes:\n\n#592: fromTryCatch on Xor and\nValidated is now catchOnly\n#553: MonadError now characterizes\ntype constructors of kind * -&gt; * instead of (*, *) -&gt; *\n#598: OneAnd&#39;s type constructor type\nparameter is now before the element type\n#610: XorT&#39;s toOption returns an\nOptionT[F, B] instead of an F[Option[B]]\n#518: Free&#39;s resume method now\nreturns an Xor instead of an Either\n#575 and\n#606: orElse on Xor and\nValidated does not unnecessarily constrain the type of the left side of the\nresult\n#577: *Aux helper classes have been\nrenamed *PartiallyApplied\n\nAnd additions:\n\n#542: WriterT\n#567: Ior.fromOptions\n#528: OptionT.fromOption\n#562: handleErrorWith and related\nhelper methods on MonadError\n#520: toNel and fromList\nconversions from List to NonEmptyList\n#533: Conversions between types with\nFoldable instances and Streaming\n#507: isJvm and isJs macros in the\nnew cats.macros.Platform\n#572: analyze on FreeApplicative\nfor compilation into a Monoid\n#587: Syntax for lifting values (and\noptional values) into Validated\n\nAnd several aliases:\n\n#492: FlatMapSyntax now includes\nfollowedBy, which is an alias for &gt;&gt;, together with a new\nfollowedByEval, which allows the caller to choose the evaluation strategy of\nthe second action\n#523: Foldable now has a\ncombineAll method that aliases fold and allows postfix usage via\nFoldableSyntax\n\nAnd a few removals:\n\n#524: FreeApplicative&#39;s redundant\nhoist, which was equivalent to compile\n#531: Coyoneda&#39;s by\n#612: Many prioritization and instance\ntraits are now private\n\nAnd bug fixes:\n\n#547: The empty values for\nMonoid[Double] and Monoid[Float] are now 0 instead of 1\n#530: Streaming.take(n).toList no\nlonger evaluates the n + 1-st element\n#538: OneAnd&#39;s instances are\nproperly prioritized\n\nThere are also many improvements to the documentation, tutorials, laws, tests,\nand benchmarks:\n\n#522: ScalaTest&#39;s === now uses Eq\ninstances\n#502: Traverse&#39;s laws verify the\nconsistency of foldMap and traverse\n#519: Benchmarks (and performance\nimprovements) for Eval\n…and many others\n\nThanks to everyone who filed issues, participated in the Cats Gitter channel,\nsubmitted code, or helped review pull requests.\nVersion 0.2.0\n\n2015 August 31\n\nVersion 0.2.0 is the second release of the Cats library.\nThe most exciting feature of this release is Scala.js support, which\ncomes courtesy of much hard work by the Scala.js community (especially\nAlistair Johnson). The SBT build configuration and project layout were\nupdated to support building for both the JVM and JS platforms.\nSince the 0.1.2 release there was wide agreement that the split\nbetween cats-core and cats-std was awkward. The two projects have\nbeen combined into cats-core, meaning that type class instances for\ncommon types like List are now available in cats-core.\nThere was also a concerted effort to improve and add documentation to\nthe project. Many people helped find typos, broken links, and places\nwhere the docs could be improved. In particular, the following\ntutorials were added or overhauled:\n\nApplicative\nConst\nFoldable\nFree\nFreeApplicative\nKleisli\nMonad\nMonoid\nSemigroup\nSemigroupK\nTraverse\nValidated\nXor\n\nSeveral new type classes and data types were introduced:\n\nChoice[F[_, _]]\nGroup[A]\nMonadReader[F[_, _], R]\nStreaming[A] and StreamingT[F[_], A]\nProd[F[_], G[_], A] and Func[F[_], A, B]\n\nSyntax tests were added to ensure that existing syntax worked, and\nthere has been some movement to enrich existing types with syntax to\nmake converting them to Cats types easier.\nThe previous Fold[A] type, which was used to support lazy folds, has\nbeen replaced with Eval[A]. This type supports both strict and lazy\nevaluation, supports lazy map and flatMap, and is trampolined for\nstack safety. The definition of Foldable#foldRight has been updated\nto something much more idiomatic and easier to reason about. The goal\nis to support laziness in Cats via the Eval[A] type wherever\npossible.\nIn addition to these specific changes there were numerous small bug\nfixes, additions, improvements, and updates. Thanks to everyone who\nfiled issues, participated in the Cats Gitter channel, submitted code,\nor helped review pull requests.\nVersion 0.1.2\n\n2015 July 17\n\n(Due to problems with publishing 0.1.0 and 0.1.1 are incomplete.)\nVersion 0.1.2 is the first non-snapshot version of the Cats library!\nIt is intended to assist the creation of dependent libraries and to be\nan early look at Cats&#39; design.\nMuch of the library is quite mature, but there are no source- or\nbinary-compatibility guarantees at this time. The overarching design\nof the library is still somewhat in flux, although mostly we expect\nthere will be new type classes, instances, and syntax. Some package\nand module boundaries may also shift.\nFor complete credits, see AUTHORS.md for a list of\npeople whose work has made this release possible.\n"}}}
