/**
 * SemigroupK is a universal semigroup which operates on kinds.
 *
 * This type class is useful when its type parameter F[_] has a
 * structure that can be combined for any particular type. Thus,
 * SemigroupK is like a Semigroup for kinds (i.e. parameterized
 * types).
 *
 * A SemigroupK[F] can produce a Semigroup[F[A]] for any type A.
 *
 * Here's how to distinguish Semigroup and SemigroupK:
 *
 *  - Semigroup[A] allows two A values to be combined.
 *
 *  - SemigroupK[F] allows two F[A] values to be combined, for any A.
 *    The combination operation just depends on the structure of F,
 *    but not the structure of A.
